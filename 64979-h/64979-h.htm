<p><span class="dropcap">“N</span>ONSENSE,” said Uncle Hayward;
“how people do like to be scared!
If a real Bengal tiger had made his
escape anywhere within twenty miles of
here, the whole country would have been up
in arms before this time. I’ve no faith in
the story.”</p>

<p>“Well, they are not quite sure of it,” replied
the neighbor who had given the information,
“but they think so. The steamer
was sunk and some of the animals were
drowned, but it is believed that the big tiger
escaped in the darkness and got ashore.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a show was it?” inquired
uncle; “a large menagerie?”</p>

<p>“No, I believe not,” was the answer;
“only a few animals that some company had
hired for the season&mdash;a tiger, a jaguar, a
pair of leopards, and a few monkeys&mdash;that’s
what they tell me. The steamer had a
heavy cargo, and went down very suddenly.”</p>

<p>“And they think the tiger made for the
woods, eh?” said uncle. “When did it happen,
do you say?”</p>

<p>“Night before last&mdash;about five miles down
the river. ’Twas a small steamer going up
to Macon. There was no one lost, I hear.”</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked uncle, “a Bengal tiger
would be an interesting neighbor, that’s certain;
and I don’t believe he would be long
in making his presence known. However,
such stories generally require a good deal
of allowance. As likely as not, there was
no tiger aboard of the steamer, after all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I reckon there was,” said the neighbor;
“but then, of course, we can’t tell; people
like excitement, and when such a rumor
gets started it grows very fast.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s true; we shall have a whole
menagerie ashore here before night. When
I was a boy, in Maine, there was a story that
a lion and an elephant had made their escape
from somebody’s show and taken to the
woods. And, dear me! it spread like the
scarlet fever! The children ran all the way
to school and all the way back; and the big
girls actually cried in the entry, they were
so frightened. Some of the mischievous
boys would make ‘elephant tracks’ in the
road, and this added to the panic. But we
never could hear of any showman who had
lost such animals, and all on a sudden the
thing came to nothing. I guess the tiger
story will end in the same way.”</p>

<p>“Why, father,” said Cousin Harold, the
fourteen-year-old boy of the family, “I don’t
see why it isn’t likely enough to be true. I
almost hope there is something in it, though
I shouldn’t want him to be killing people’s
cattle and things. Just think of it&mdash;a big
Bengal tiger, and right here in Georgia, too!
How I should like to have a chance at him
with my gun!”</p>

<p>“Why, Harold,” said his mother, “how
you talk. If I believed such a creature to
be anywhere in the neighborhood, I’d shut
you up in the smoke-house rather that let
you go into the woods.”</p>

<p>“What, and make bacon of a poor fellow?”
replied the young lad, gayly.</p>

<p>Uncle Hayward and his family were New
England people, who had settled in Georgia
near the Ocmulgee River, where I was now
paying them a really delightful visit. Harold
and myself, being very fond of hunting,
spent much time together in pursuit of the
various kinds of game to be found in the
region. Many an old “mammy” and many
an “Uncle Remus” was made the happier
by the gift of some fat ’coon or juicy ’possum
which we brought down from the tall
timber.</p>

<p>Inspired as we were with all the enthusiasm
of young sportsmen, the thought of
an escaped tiger had a pleasing excitement
for us. We were, therefore, a little disappointed
when another of our neighbors,
stopping for a few minutes as he passed
the house, made very light of the rumor,
saying it was only a foolish story to frighten
people.</p>

<p>“A tiger would soon make ugly work
among the cattle,” he remarked, “and it
would be no joking matter to have one about
the neighborhood.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” replied Uncle Hayward.
“I don’t know, though,” he added, “but I’d
risk my big Jersey with him. I’m thinking
’twould be about ‘which and t’other’ between
the two, as the saying is.”</p>

<p>Harold and I could subscribe to this
opinion very heartily, for it was not more
than a week since that dangerous old Jersey
had chased us out of his pasture, bellowing
at our heels as we ran. Nevertheless,
he was a noble fellow to look upon&mdash;just
as handsome as a horned creature could
be. What a thick, strong neck he had, what
a broad, curled front, and what shapely
flanks! Most of the time he spent browsing
in the large pasture some little distance from
the house, and it required a good measure
of courage upon the part of the trespasser
to cross this area.</p>

<p>No wonder, then, that Harold and myself
made a wide detour, when, half an hour
later, armed with our shotguns, we set out
for the woods beyond the Jersey’s domain.
But it is needless to say that our minds were
more taken up with the thought of the tiger
than with the fear of our former enemy.
It was just possible that a great, stealthy,
tawny shape might be prowling through the
very timber in which we were; and I will
not deny that it required little in the way
of sight or sound to set our hearts beating
faster than usual on that day.</p>

<p>After killing a wild-cat, a raccoon, and a
number of large fox squirrels, we turned
our steps homeward, not at all sorry to have
made no startling discovery in confirmation
of the rumor which had so interested us in
the morning. The truth was, that the
deeper we were in the woods the less pleasure
we found in calling up the image of that
escaped tiger!</p>

<p>We were just nearing the Hayward plantation,
Harold with the wild-cat slung over
his shoulder and I with the ’coon upon
mine, when on a sudden our attention was
arrested by a strange, long-drawn noise, like
the cry of some large animal. It resembled
the call of a great cat, but was deeper and
more thrilling than any cat-note that we had
ever heard.</p>

<p>I need not say that it startled us; and
when, in a few moments, it was repeated,
with the addition of a sort of scream, we
looked at each other with blanched faces:
when, clutching our guns more firmly, we
started into a run. I think we had never
realized till then that two boys of fourteen,
armed only with light shotguns, could be
no match for a royal tiger, just escaped
from his cage and hungry for prey.</p>

<p>Pray, dear reader, do not condemn us
hastily, for you would have run, too.</p>

<p>Our course took us directly across the
pasture where the big Jersey had his
range. He was lying down for the time,
and we almost stumbled over him. Springing
up and lowering his sharp horns, he
took after us with a kind of yelling roar
that bespoke anything but a friendly intention.</p>

<p>We dropped our game and bounded on
like a couple of young greyhounds: but we
were far out from the nearest fence, and
saw that he must soon overtake us with his
mad, thundering rush. Right ahead of us
stood a scrub oak, with branches near the
ground, and into this we sprang just in time
to avoid those terrible horns which would
have tossed us like wisps of straw.</p>

<p>He was so close upon us that it was impossible
to secure our guns, and we dropped
them at the foot of the tree, where they fell
rattling between two small rocks, which fortunately
protected them from his trampling
hoofs.</p>

<p>Then he besieged us in true form, walking
all about our fortress, with a hoarse,
frightful bellowing that sometimes grew
to a shriek, and tearing up the earth with
his horns till his whole body was coated
with turf.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Harold, “we are safe
enough in this tree, but who wants to be
kept here all night? He is so apt to roar
that, even if father or any of the work folks
should hear him, they might not come to
see what the matter was. Besides, it’s a
long distance to the house, and the hill
yonder is right in the way.”</p>

<p>So we remained watching our savage
jailer, quite forgetting for the moment the
sounds we had just heard from the woods.
How long would the old fellow continue to
bellow and fling up the dirt? I was asking
some such question when my cousin uttered
a quick exclamation.</p>

<p>“Oh, see! look yonder!” he cried; “there’s
the tiger now!”</p>

<p>I looked where he pointed, and my heart
gave a thump that was almost suffocating.</p>

<p>There, creeping close to the ground, was
a powerful yellow shape, marked with jet-black
stripes. The ears were flattened, and
the long tail, reaching straight out on a level
with the body, had a wavy motion that I
distinctly remember to this hour. Warily,
silently, and just upon the point of making
a spring for his victim, the fearful creature
was stealing upon the unsuspicious bull.</p>

<p>Though half paralyzed by the scene, we
still retained some presence of mind. Perhaps
a shout might delay the attack, and we
gave one with all the power of our throats.</p>

<p>The monster seemed to hesitate, raising
his head a little, as he crouched in his tracks,
and at that moment the old Jersey discovered
him.</p>

<p>In an instant a change came over the
scene. Tossing his head in a kind of fierce
surprise, the horned brute faced his foe;
then, dropping his sharp bayonets to a lower
level, he plunged toward the intruder.</p>

<p>Evidently the tiger was unprepared for
this, but with remarkable quickness he
seemed to take in the situation. Without
an instant’s hesitation, he bounded over to
a large boulder which lay near by, and with
the greatest agility leaped lightly to its top,
where he stood regarding the Jersey with
wide-open jaws.</p>

<p>“Now’s the time,” said Harold, excitedly;
“we must hurry and get our guns.”
And down we went hustling through the
thick limbs of the oak.</p>

<p>It was our first impulse to fire at the tiger
from the ground where we stood, but, as
the bull kept directly in the way, it was
evident that this would not answer; and,
besides, our very terror restrained us; it
might be easier to fire than to kill.</p>

<p>Getting back into the tree with our guns,
both of which contained heavy charges of
buckshot, we quickly posted ourselves so
as to improve the first opening for a fair
aim. The tiger still crouched upon his rock
of refuge, roaring close in the face of his
enemy, yet hesitating to spring upon him;
while the strong-necked old Jersey shook
his curly head and fairly screamed at the
yellow brute he was not quite able to reach.</p>

<p>A bull’s voice in a rage is a strange mixture
of frightful sounds, even more so than
a tiger’s.</p>

<p>We had our guns leveled, watching our
opportunity. Presently the striped terror
sprang up from his crouching posture,
raising himself threateningly upon his hind
feet, with his tawny breast fully exposed.
Since then I have often seen an angry tiger
rear himself in the same way against the
bars of his cage. There could not have been
a fairer mark for us, and both our guns
spoke at once with a “bang!”</p>

<p>Through the smoke we saw the great
brute tip fairly over and fall upon his back.
Then, convulsively, he bounded straight up
from the rock two or three times, and at
last, plunging forward, landed directly upon
the bull’s horns.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp78" id="i_160" style="max-width: 49.1875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_160.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>HIS HORNS PIERCED THE TAWNY SIDE</p></div>
  </div>

<p>The next moment, heavy as he was, he
was hurled ten feet in the air, and when
he fell it was only to be tossed again.
A dozen or twenty times he was thus
thrown aloft, although after the first minute
he was evidently as dead as he ever
could be.</p>

<p>After this the old Jersey appeared to
enjoy much in pitching him along the
ground to a considerable distance, following
up the body as it fell, and sending it on
before him as if it had weighed no more
than a dead cat.</p>

<p>We were glad to witness this performance,
as it occupied the old fellow’s whole
attention, and so gave us an opportunity to
slip away unnoticed, which we very quickly
did.</p>

<p>No grass grew under our feet as we ran
over the high ground between us and the
house, which, as the plantation was quite
large, was nearly a mile distant.</p>

<p>With scarcely breath enough to relate our
story, we told it, to the astonishment of
Harold’s parents,
whose thankfulness
for our escape, when
they had learned how
narrow that escape
had been, was inexpressible.</p>

<p>It required a considerable
force of men
and boys to recover
the body of the slain
tiger in face of the
bull’s threatening demonstrations;
but it was
nevertheless secured
and brought home.
It was then found,
upon examination, that
our charges of buckshot
had undoubtedly
done the business for
the fierce brute, so that
he must have been
nearly dead when
caught upon those
stout horns.</p>

<p>“A tiger in the State
of Georgia,” said Uncle
Hayward; “a true
Bengal tiger! Well, I must own that I was
wrong; I thought this morning it was only
a silly story. Boys, you and the bull have
done a great thing for the community!”</p>

<p>“But, oh, the peril!” said Harold’s
mother: “suppose we had known it at the
moment! It was a double danger.”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother,” replied Harold; “it was
double, but it was that very thing which
saved us. If we hadn’t waked up the Jersey,
the tiger would have had us very soon.”</p>

  CHAPTER XIII<br />
  POLLY AND THE MINISTER
  </h3>

<h4>SYNOPSIS OF PREVIOUS CHAPTERS.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Polly Prentiss is an orphan who, for the greater
part of her life, has lived with a distant relative,
Mrs. Manser, the mistress of Manser Farm. Miss
Hetty Pomeroy, a maiden lady of middle age, has,
ever since the death of her favorite niece, been on
the lookout for a little girl whom she might adopt.
She is attracted by Polly’s appearance and quaint
manners, and finally decides to take her home and
keep her for a month’s trial. In the foregoing
chapters, Polly has arrived at her new home, and
the great difference between the way of living at
Pomeroy Oaks and her past life affords her much
food for wonderment.</p>
</div>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>UNDAY was usually a hard day for
Polly. In the first place there were
good clothes to be put on and taken
care of, and then there was sitting still in
church! Sitting still was the most difficult
thing in the world for Polly.</p>

<p>“In the Manser pew I could wriggle, because
it was ’way back and nobody downstairs
saw me, but I guess I’ve got to behave
just like grown folks to-day,” said
Polly, anxiously, as she put on the brown
cashmere frock Sunday morning. “But if
I listen to the minister most of the time,
and think about Eleanor when I get tired
listening, perhaps I can do it.”</p>

<p>It was not so hard after all, for the minister
had a pleasant, boyish face, and he
used simple language, which Polly could
understand. Besides that, his sermon was
short&mdash;the shortest one Polly had ever
heard; she wondered if by any chance the
minister could know about those yellow
cakes he was to have for dessert, and felt
in a hurry to taste them. Miss Pomeroy
had seen him the day before.</p>

<p>“He looks as if he liked to eat good
things,” thought Polly, as the minister read
the closing hymn, “and Miss Pomeroy may
have told him there was citron in them.
His cheeks are as red as mine were&mdash;redder
than mine are to-day.”</p>

<p>This was comforting, and, moreover, it
was true. Polly had been out of doors very
little for the last week, and, besides that, although
she was not unhappy, the thought
of Eleanor was continually before her, and
the fear of falling below an unknown standard
made her anxious and troubled many
times in the day. So the roses in Polly’s
cheeks did not bloom as brightly as they
had at Manser Farm, and the little girl was
greatly encouraged.</p>

<p>During the service she could not turn
around to see her old friends up in the dimly
lighted gallery, and when the benediction
had been pronounced Miss Pomeroy said
she and Polly would sit quietly in the pew
until the minister came out. The little girl
looked disturbed, and Miss Pomeroy laid
her hand on Polly’s with a smile.</p>

<p>“You needn’t be afraid of the minister,
my dear,” she said, kindly, “he likes children,
and has two little sisters at home.”</p>

<p>Polly smiled faintly in return. When
the minister came, and they had all walked
slowly down the aisle together, there was
no sign of the Manser wagon, but Polly
was sure she could hear it way up the road;
it had a peculiar rattle, not to be mistaken
for any other. The little girl had a sober
face as she climbed up into the seat beside
Hiram, with the minister’s help.</p>

<p>“I’m grateful I’ve got you instead of the
preacher,” said Hiram, facing straight
ahead, as soon as Miss Pomeroy and the
minister were fairly launched in conversation.
“I’ve always been to church, and I’m
a member, but I’m scared of speaking to
’em; it don’t make any difference whether
they’re young or old. What’s the matter,
honey? Don’t you tell me without you’re
a mind to.”</p>

<p>“I thought perhaps I’d see the Manser
Farm folks,” said Polly. “I thought maybe
Uncle Blodgett would want to wait, and
Aunty Peebles. I don’t know as Mrs.
Ramsdell came if her rheumatism was
bad.”</p>

<p>“She was there,” said Hiram, quietly,
“I know ’em all by sight, and once in
awhile I have a little talk with Mr. Manser
when we’re taking the horses out of the
sheds. But to-day Mrs. Manser hurried
him up, and hustled the three old folks into
the wagon as if something was after her.
I shouldn’t have dared to offer Mis’ Ramsdell
anything unless I’d wanted it bit in
halves, when she got in,” said Hiram, with
a low chuckle. “She spoke her mind good
and free, too: I don’t recall ever hearing
any one speak freer. She was all for waiting
to see you.”</p>

<p>“Then I think Mrs. Manser was real
mean,” said Polly, with flushed cheeks. “I
don’t suppose she meant to be, but I think
she was!”</p>

<p>Hiram reached out his big brown hand
and gave Polly’s fingers a sympathetic
squeeze.</p>

<p>“I expect we are about as naughty as we
can be, both of us,” he said, softly, “but I
take real comfort in it once in a while.
That Manser woman’s no favorite of mine,
nor ever was. I can’t abide her.”</p>

<p>“She took care of me for seven years,”
said Polly, with a spasm of loyalty, forgetting
how little of the care had really come
on Mrs. Manser’s shoulders, “and I do try
to love her.”</p>

<p>“Love don’t always come by trying,”
said Hiram, tranquilly, “but I suppose it’s
no harm to give it a fair chance. And as
for those old folks of yours, you shall see
’em next Sunday, if I have to tole Mr.
Manser down behind the sheds and keep
him there.”</p>

<p>Then Hiram puckered his lips and softly
whistled “Duke Street” all the rest of the
way to Pomeroy Oaks, while Polly sat beside
him, much cheered and comforted.</p>

<p>Dinner was an exciting meal to the little
girl. It was the first time, as she told
Arctura afterward, that Polly had even
seen a minister eat. This minister not only
ate with great heartiness, but he talked a
good deal and frequently smiled across the
table at her, and he had a jolly laugh.
Polly was glad of that for more than one
reason. Arctura had covered the scratch
on her nose with a long, broad strip of
black court-plaster, and this decoration
made her naturally prominent feature more
noticeable than ever. She carried her head
very high, and bore the dishes in and out
with a stately tread, but her eyes twinkled
so when she looked at Polly that the little
girl had much ado to keep a straight face.</p>

<p>When the dessert came, Polly held her
breath while the minister ate his first
mouthful of a yellow cake; he had chosen
it instead of one of Arctura’s “snowflakes.”
Miss Pomeroy had tasted one the day before
and pronounced it delicious. The
minister ate every crumb, and when the
plate was passed to him a second time, he
laughed boyishly.</p>

<p>“These are almost too good,” he said.
“I should like to compliment the cook.”</p>

<p>Miss Pomeroy smiled at Polly.</p>

<p>“My little guest made them,” said she.</p>

<p>“Dear me,” said the minister, heartily.
“I shall have to tell my sisters about this
when I go home. One of them must be
just about Mary’s age; she is eight years
old.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I’m going on eleven,” said
Polly, eagerly, “only I’m small for my age,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, that’s very surprising,” and the
minister smiled most cordially at the little
cook. Polly was perfectly delighted when
Miss Pomeroy suggested that instead of a
nap she might take a walk with the minister
and show him the grounds. Miss
Pomeroy was to drive him back to Deacon
Talcott’s house late in the afternoon.</p>

<p>“I will take my nap as usual, Mary, if
you think you can look after Mr. Endicott,”
she had said, and the minister and Polly
exchanged a glance of much confidence and
friendliness.</p>

<p>They walked about, hand in hand, and
there was no doubt that Polly entertained
the minister.</p>

<p>“Miss Pomeroy tells me she hopes you
will stay with her for always,” the minister
said, as they stood together looking down
at the brook in a place where it tinkled
over some stones. Polly gave a little cry
of delight and squeezed the minister’s hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, did she say it that way?” she asked,
earnestly.</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” said the young man, smiling
down at her, “didn’t you know it?”</p>

<p>“She’s a beautiful, kind lady,” said Polly,
shaking her brown curls till they danced,
“and I do truly love her, but she’s so tall
and quiet I shouldn’t like to ask her questions
all the time, and I have to ask her
a good many&mdash;about my clothes and ever
so many other things. Now if it was you,
I shouldn’t be a bit afraid, because your
eyes look so young and happy,” said the
little girl, frankly. “Miss Pomeroy has sad
eyes, and I’m always afraid I’ll make them
sadder. Don’t you see?”</p>

<p>“I think I do,” said the minister, gently,
“but I am sure you will help Miss Pomeroy’s
eyes, and not hurt them, by talking
freely to her.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Polly, doubtfully. “Do
your little sisters like to read, Mr. Endicott?
I am reading a book called ‘Sesame
and Lilies,’ by Mr. Ruskin.”</p>

<p>“Phew!” said the minister. “That’s a
fine book, Mary, but I should say it was
a little old for you. Who chose it&mdash;Miss
Pomeroy?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I chose it myself,” said Polly,
proudly, “off the shelf where all the little
books are, under the window. Miss Pomeroy
said I could choose.”</p>

<p>“When we go in the house,” said the
minister, as they started on together, swinging
hands, “I’ll show you a book to read;
I saw it on one of the shelves. It’s a big
book, but the stories are short. If I were
in your place, Mary, I’d read one of them
to-morrow. My little sisters love them
all.”</p>

<p>So it came about that when Miss Pomeroy
and the minister drove away they left
on the piazza a little girl whose heart was
almost gay, for the book the minister had
chosen, and which Miss Pomeroy had told
Polly she might keep in her own room, was
full of delightful pictures, and on the cover
was printed in gold letters. “Wonder
Stories, by Hans Christian Andersen.”</p>

<p>“And mind you try to remember them
just as you do the sermon on Sunday,” the
minister had said, as he parted from Polly,
“for they are sure to give you happy
thoughts.” And Polly, running to Arctura,
who was seated on the south porch in
a chair that rocked with a loud squeak, cried
joyfully:</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Arctura, the minister has
chosen a book for me, one that his sisters
love! And I’m not going to read another
word in ‘Sesame and Lilies’ till I’m most
grown up! For Miss Pomeroy said ’twas
a wise thought and an inper&mdash;impterposition
of Providence!”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV<br />
IN THE WOODS</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>OLLY’S worry about being satisfactory
to Miss Pomeroy had departed
with the minister’s words, down by
the brook, but as she lay in bed the next
morning, listening to the birds out in a big
elm tree, the branches of which came near
one of her windows, she had some sober
thoughts.</p>

<p>“The reason Miss Pomeroy is going to
adopt me,” said Polly, to herself, “is because
she thinks I’m like Eleanor. I’m not
like her, inside, of course, but I’m trying
to be. Now, don’t you be a selfish girl,
Polly Prentiss. You’ve got a beautiful
home with a lovely, kind lady, that does
things for you all the time, and Miss Arctura
and Mr. Hiram besides, just as
good as they can be, and the kittens to
play with, and Daisy out in her stall, and
you can go off into the woods this afternoon,
and take the book that the minister’s
sisters love, and perhaps they’ll let you go
again some other day.</p>

<p>“And all you’ve got to do,” said Polly,
severely, to herself, “is to stop wanting to
run outdoors morning, noon, and night,
and wanting to play with a doll, and wishing
somebody’d call you Polly, and not
mind having to eat so much, or lying down
on this bed that gets so hot in the afternoon,
and stop being lonesome for the folks at
Manser Farm, and learn how to mend your
clothes. I guess that’s about all, and it
isn’t much for a girl that’s going on
eleven.”</p>

<p>Polly had a delightful time that afternoon.
Arctura had taken in the snow-white
clothes from the line, and informed
the little girl that she had no intention of
ironing that day, and would make an excursion
into the woods with her.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a crick in my back,” Miss Green
announced, when Polly descended from her
hour on the bed, “and what I need is to get
right down close to nature. I’ll take my old
gray shawl and pick me out a good place
to sit in the sun, and I’ll knit on Hiram’s
socks while you run around and see what
you can see. Perhaps you can get up a
bouquet to fetch home to Miss Hetty, who
knows? And when you feel so minded you
can sit on the shawl alongside of me, and
read me out a story, maybe. It’s a pity
Miss Hetty can’t be with us, but she’s no
hand to walk; she hasn’t been overly strong
for ten years back, though she can do all
that’s required.”</p>

<p>Polly felt disloyal to Miss Pomeroy, because
it was a relief to know Arctura would
be her only companion. Her little heart
was full of affectionate gratitude, but the
tall mistress of the house inspired a good
deal of awe as well, while with Arctura
Polly had a sense of comradeship, in spite
of the difference in years, and was not afraid
to chatter like a magpie.</p>

<p>By three o’clock the pair were deep in
the woods, and Arctura was enthroned on
her gray shawl, spread on a rock that stood
like a table in an open space between giant
pines. She had four knitting-needles and
a ball of flaming red yarn in her hands, and
looked the picture of contentment.</p>

<p>“Now,” she said, drawing out a big silver
watch from the front of her gown, and
placing it beside her on the shawl, “it’s only
a few minutes past three. You lay your
book down here and don’t let me see you
again for an hour, or as near that as you
can judge by your feelings. Don’t stray
so far you can’t get back. I’ll holler once
in awhile so’s to keep track of you, but you
caper round and see what you find.”</p>

<p>Polly trotted off obediently, and found all
sorts of treasures. If she had not been
obliged to respond to Arctura’s loud
“Ma-a-a-ry!” three or four times, it would
have seemed to the little girl that she was
all alone in a new world, for the pine grove
was unlike the woods through which Polly
had wandered in that far-away time when
she lived at Manser Farm. Those were
birches and scrubby oaks, with an occasional
hemlock, and you had to look out
for slippery tree-roots, and scratching underbrush,
and boggy places. But this
wood had a soft brown carpet of needles,
and a border of beautiful ferns, and here
and there were little cones, and clumps of
stems that had belonged to “Dutchman’s
pipes.”</p>

<p>In a little while there would be “wake-robins”
and “Solomon’s seal,” and many
other wild wood flowers. Polly saw the
first signs of a venturesome “lady’s slipper.”
She gathered long trails of Princess
pine and looped them around her waist,
and she picked some of the prettiest ferns
to take home to Miss Pomeroy. There
were several cleared places, like the one
which held Arctura’s throne. Polly named
one the library and another the parlor, and
in still another there were some stones
which made her think of pillows.</p>

<p>“So I shall name that the bedroom,” she
said to Arctura when the call “Ti-i-i-mes
up!” had brought her running back, “and
this I think we’d better call the dining room,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Seems a sensible name to me,” said
Miss Green, approvingly. “Now suppose
you read me out a story. I just looked into
your book while you were off, and here’s
one that my eye lit on; suppose we have
that.”</p>

<p>The story was “The Ugly Duckling,”
and the words were so easy that Polly read
on and on, scarcely ever having to stop
for Arctura’s help. When she had finished
it, she drew a long breath and shut the
book.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it a beautiful, interesting story,
Miss Arctura?” she asked, eagerly, and her
friend nodded with great vigor before she
spoke.</p>

<p>“It’s what I call fair,” said Arctura, with
decision, “and that’s what I like in real life
or in a story. And that’s why I expect
that the poor folks that get hurt and
slammed around and put upon in this world
are going to have crowns of gold and harps
of silver and songs of everlasting praise
and joy in the next one; or whatever those
things stand for, to ’em. We’ll have another
of those stories next time we come
out a pleasuring together, won’t we?”</p>

<p>Polly assented with joy, and all through
the talk that followed, while she told of her
morning’s trip to the village, those delightful
words “next time” rang out their lovely
promise in Polly’s happy ears.</p>

<p>She and Arctura walked home arm in
arm, although that meant that Polly had
to stretch up, and Miss Green to reach
down, but the path was broad enough for
two, and they sang “Marching Through
Georgia,” and stepped gayly along to the
brisk measures.</p>

<p>“Slow walking, except for those that
have infirmities and are obliged,” said Arctura,
“is a trial of the flesh and spirit, or
it might be, if it ain’t,” and little Polly, with
more color in her cheeks than had been
there for days, looked joyfully up at her.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Arctura,” she said, fervently,
“you do have such splendid ideas!”</p>

<p>“Don’t try to flatter an old lady of fifty-four,
child,” said Miss Green, shaking her
ball of yarn at Polly with pretended severity.
“You turn your mind on those
clouds; see how the wind’s backing round
through the north? I can smell the east,”
and she sniffed with her nose well in the
air. “We’re in for rain to-morrow, I do
believe. It’ll be just the day for you to
write that letter you’re going to send with
the candy, and there’s a number of matters
you can help me about, and if you’ve got
any mending to do maybe we’ll find time
to sit down together, and I’ll relate that
story about the Square and me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” said Polly, as they
marched up the driveway, “and I’ve got to
practice with Mr. Hiram, you know. I expect
it will be a grand day!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Fence_Man">The Fence Man
    </h2>

<hr class="r5" />

<p class="h2sub">By Mrs. F. M. Howard</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="dropcap">“M</span>AMMA, what is the great, high fence
for?” asked a childish voice. “Is
the man afraid we’s will go into his
yard?”</p>

<p>“I do not know, dear. It was there before
we came.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he thinks we’ll steal his cherries.”
Horace straightened himself, scornfully.</p>

<p>“Huh, I guess we can buy our cherries if
we want any,” said Rodney, with flashing
eyes.</p>

<p>“Perhaps other boys have not thought
so,” interposed the mother’s gentle voice;
“and since the fence was there before we
came, and so cannot have any possible
reference to us, we will not harbor ill will
against our neighbor because of it.”</p>

<p>“Young-ones,” muttered a surly voice on
the other side of the high board fence.
“Just my luck to have a pack of young-ones
unloaded on me. Just one degree worse
than the widder’s long tongue, I’ll venture.
I’m glad the fence is good and high, and I’ll
put a row of pickets on top of it if they go
to climbing.”</p>

<p>Old Mr. Harding dropped down on a
garden seat, wiping the moisture from his
heated brow with a warlike bandana. He
had been putting out late tomato plants, and
his back ached; possibly his heart ached,
too, for he was old and lonely. He could
have told to a mathematical nicety, had he
had the mind to do so, just why the ugly
board fence divided him from his neighbor,
of the quarrel between himself and the fiery
widow, who owned the cottage where the
children had come to live, over a boundary
line, the matter of a foot or less of ground
between the two places.</p>

<p>A quarrel is like a tumble weed in its
capacity for growing in size, and, tossed
back and forth by the windy tongues of the
Widow Barlow, who gloried in “speaking
her mind,” and old Mr. Harding, who cherished
his right to the last word as religiously
as a woman, the original difference had
grown to be a very serious thing, indeed.</p>

<p>“I’ll fix her!” he had exclaimed, after the
last tilt of words which occurred between
them. “I’ll put up a fence so high she can’t
scream over it, and if she comes inside my
yard I’ll buy a dog.”</p>

<p>He thoroughly enjoyed that bit of spite
work, and amused himself immensely in
overseeing the ungainly structure as it went
up, completely obstructing the objectionable
widow’s view on the east side.</p>

<p>She had no redress, for he had given her
the benefit of the disputed line, and a man
could put up bill boards on his property if
he wished to, and he hugged himself to
think of her rage and disgust.</p>

<p>He did not in the least overestimate it,
and he heard with glee from the neighbors
and the housekeeper the savage onslaughts
on his character which she was making, and
it was not long before a moving van backed
up before her door, a “To rent” sign appeared,
and Mr. Harding was alone with
victory. He was soured in the operation,
it must be confessed. No man can habitually
nurse hatred and spite in his bosom
without becoming contaminated.</p>

<p>When gentle, soft-voiced Mrs. Harding
was living, with her generous heart and
hand, her noiseless, unostentatious way of
settling a difficulty, it would have been quite
impossible for him to have indulged in such
an exhibition; she would have loved him out
of it insensibly, and have so limbered the
widow’s acrimonious tongue with the oil of
kindness that the quarrel would have died
at birth; but it was a sorry day for him
when the better part of himself was laid
away under the green in the cemetery, and
he was quite free to be his untrammeled self.</p>

<p>Some way the mother’s voice, as it floated
over the top of the ugly fence, reminded
him of her. It was such a gentle, loving
voice, with a flute-like clearness in it which
made every word audible.</p>

<p>They had never had any children, he and
the wife who would have made such a tender
mother, but he imagined she would have
spoken to them just as this mother was
speaking if she had been surrounded by
active, questioning lads and lasses, and his
surly mood softened as he heard them chattering
over the treasures of broken china
they were finding in the widow’s refuse
heap.</p>

<p>“We’ll build the playhouse right here.
The big, high boards will make such a nice
back,” said little Barbara.</p>

<p>“Maybe the man won’t like us to drive
nails in his fence,” Rodney suggested.</p>

<p>“But this side of it is ours,” laughed the
mother, softly. “He can only claim one
side of even a nuisance; but you must be
careful not to annoy him with too much
noise.”</p>

<p>One side of a nuisance. How truly it
was a nuisance, for Mr. Harding did not
admire stockades himself. He had seen the
inside of one in war times, and he had very
nearly lost his life in trying to escape from
it. He had an old wound in his leg yet that
made him crosser on damp days than in dry
weather, and here he was erecting stockades
in his old age, to keep people out instead of
in. It took all his self-control to keep from
being ashamed.</p>

<p>Day after day he heard the childish prattle,
and the pounding of nails as the building
of the playhouse went on, sometimes with
wrath, at other times with an almost eager
curiosity to see and hear the little flock at
their pretty play.</p>

<p>One day it rained, and silence reigned in
the garden. His wound twinged and
prickled all day, and he was in a furious
mood toward evening as he went to
straighten up some weak-backed plants that
the rain had lopped over. A kitten was
frisking about in a bed of choice strawberry
plants&mdash;a saucy, disrespectful kitten which
had evidently braved the terrors of the
stockade, as he had done himself in the
years gone by. He hated cats almost as he
hated loud-voiced widows&mdash;perhaps he was
thinking of the Widow Barlow, and of the
joy it would be to take her as he was taking
the kitten (loving little creature, it had
never felt the touch of hatred, and didn’t
know enough to run away), and, with one
twist of his avenging arm, sling her over
the fence. The kitten went over, legs and
tail wildly outstretched, and little Barbara
was at the window.</p>

<p>“Oh, mamma, he threw my darlin’ kitty
right over the fence,” he heard her shriek,
sobbingly, as she ran out and picked up her
pet. “Kitty, kitty, is you killed?” she cried,
breathlessly, as the little creature, stunned
for a moment by its fall, closed its eyes and
lay limply in her arms as she ran into the
house.</p>

<p>“Mean old thing. If I was a man, I’d
thrash him,” said Horace, doubling his little
fists savagely.</p>

<p>“No, no, little ones; we must love him
into kindness,” Mrs. Manning observed,
gently. “He is a poor, lonely old man with
no one to coax him into nice ways. See,
Kitty isn’t hurt. Give her some milk and
she will soon be quite happy again,” and in
ministering to the kitten the children forgot
their revengeful thoughts: but over the
fence an old, cross-grained man went into
his finer house with a mean feeling in his
heart which even the thought of the Widow
Barlow could not change to a comfortable
complacency.</p>

<p>The rain cleared away and the family
were very busy in the garden. The small
plat on the south corner, away from the
baleful shadow of the fence, was full of the
roses and shrubs which the Widow Barlow
had planted and tended so carefully, and
they were already full of buds. Mrs. Manning
was exceedingly fond of flowers, too,
and her bay window on the west side was
full of choice plants.</p>

<p>There was a Papa Manning, but he went
early and came late from his work, too early
and late to enter the story as an active factor;
one of those busy men who do business
in the city and live in suburban towns for
the sake of health and purer air for the children;
but Mr. Harding did not know this,
and supposed his new neighbor to be a
widow, and cherished suspicions accordingly
which not even her sweet voice could
quite allay.</p>

<p>“Oh, mamma, come quick. The man has
fallen,” screamed Barbara one day, as she
ran in to her mother, her golden curls flying,
her blue eyes full of fright.</p>

<p>“What man, Barbie dear?” Mrs. Manning
was in the kitchen making bread, and
a man was an indefinite ingredient to enter
into the delicate operation without proper
credentials.</p>

<p>“The old man, mamma. The fence man&mdash;he
fell right down and groaned.” A
neighbor in distress&mdash;that was quite another
matter, and Mrs. Manning ran out hastily,
drying her hands on her apron.</p>

<p>“I’ve sprained my ankle, I guess,”
growled Mr. Harding, nursing his wounded
leg with a white face full of angry impatience.
“Just a bit of a stone, but enough
to turn that confounded weak bone of mine.
I feel like a baby, ma’am, to be upset by
such a trifle.”</p>

<p>“Lean on me, sir, and I will help you to
rise,” said Mrs. Manning; but at the first
attempt the poor old gentleman nearly
fainted.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there were men near at hand,
and soon Mr. Harding was carried into
his home by strong hands, and a physician
summoned.</p>

<p>It would be an exaggeration to say that
Mr. Harding submitted to suffering with
sweet resignation. In his best days gentle
Mrs. Harding needed all her stock of
patience to endure him when he was ill, and
his natural proclivities had been reinforced
by years of loneliness and self-indulgence.
The housekeeper was at her wits’ end, and
strongly inclined to resign her situation before
the end of the first week.</p>

<p>“Sure, ma’am, he’s that cranky there’s no
living with him at all,” she confided to Mrs.
Manning, who had brought in a bit of her
own delicate cookery to tempt his capricious
appetite. “I make his toast and his coffee
of a mornin’, and he’s ready to eat me
when it’s on his table because the coffee
ain’t a-bilin’ and a-sissin’ hot, an’ the egg
maybe has been cooked ten seconds longer
than his wife used to cook it for him.”</p>

<p>“Let me go in and prepare his table while
you get the food ready,” Mrs. Manning
suggested. She had waited on just such
an invalid once in her lifetime, and had
ideas.</p>

<p>“All right, ma’am. I’ll be right glad of
a little help, for he do try my patience all
to frags.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Manning ran home quickly, and returned
bringing a dainty tea cloth and a
bouquet of her window flowers in a delicate
glass vase, and, going into the dining room,
she soon had the little invalid table a very
poem of neatness and elegance.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Harrihan never set that table, I’ll
be bound,” he said, gruffly, as Mrs. Manning
carried it to his bedside.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Harrihan is busy and I am helping
her a little,” replied Mrs. Manning, gently.
“Let me raise the shade and make you more
comfortable for your dinner.”</p>

<p>The window looked out upon the staring
high fence, over which the roof and chimney
of her own little cottage was visible, and
Mr. Harding’s wrinkled face had the grace
to gather a flush.</p>

<p>“Are you a widow, ma’am?” he demanded
after a few moments, during which
she had moved about the untidy room, picking
up the morning papers, which he had
slung away after reading them, and turning
with deft hands the furniture into more
home-like positions. Mrs. Harrihan was a
good housekeeper but a poor home maker.</p>

<p>“A widow? Dear me, I hope not.
Haven’t you seen Mr. Manning frolicing
with the children evenings? He comes in
the back way, as it saves a block in coming
from the station.”</p>

<p>No, Mr. Harding had not observed a man
about the place, and for an excellent reason&mdash;the
fence shut off his view of the charming
domestic life of his neighbors completely,
and for the first time since its erection
he wished it was back in the lumber
yard. He had the grace to thank her, and
to ask her to come again, after Mrs. Harrihan’s
entrance with his dinner, saying that
it would taste better with the flowers to look
at, and Mrs. Manning poured his tea and
buttered his toast, with a great pity for him
in his loneliness in her warm heart.</p>

<p>It was the flowers at last which accomplished
the downfall of the spitework fence.
Acting on the hint of his pleasure in the
bouquet on his dinner table, Mrs. Manning
kept him supplied with them in liberal
measure.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barlow’s roses were now in riotous
bloom, and every day a fresh bouquet
brightened the sick room. On account of
the old wound, the injured ankle did not
readily yield to treatment, and for weeks
Mr. Harding was an unwilling prisoner,
forced to look out at that unyielding expanse
of pine until his very soul was sick
of it.</p>

<p>He told his grievance in full detail to Mrs.
Manning one day with an apologetic air,
not willing that his cheery little neighbor,
whom he was beginning to respect so much,
should think that he indulged in high board
fences as a matter of taste.</p>

<p>She heard the story of the Widow Barlow’s
delinquencies smilingly, and contrived
to throw such a wide mantle of charity,
trimmed with humor, over the matter that
Mr. Harding actually laughed&mdash;and at his
own folly.</p>

<p>Even little Barbara lost her fear of “the
fence man,” and, after bringing him several
bouquets by way of visits of sympathy, she
one day made him a social call with the
kitten in her arms, also a ball and string
with which to show off its accomplishments,
and old Mr. Harding actually smiled, and
forgot that he hated cats in watching the
frolicsome little creature chasing its tail, the
ball, or Barbara as she ran with the string.</p>

<p>One day there was the sound of pounding
and rending on the Harding premises, and
all the children ran excitedly to see.</p>

<p>Carpenters were tearing the spite fence
down, and Barbara was in despair for her
playhouse, but her childish heart was comforted,
for Mr. Harding had given orders,
and, when the workmen reached the spot,
the boards were sawed down and shaped
to match the rest of the structure, and with
the dearest little window cut in, to the
child’s great delight.</p>

<p>With the fence went every vestige of Mr.
Harding’s crustiness toward his new neighbors.
Not since his wife’s death had he
been so genial and friendly, and the children
were a constant source of interest and delight.
It even came to pass, through Mrs.
Manning’s mediation, that the matter of the
boundary line was at last compromised
without serious friction, and Mr. Harding
really came to confess, to himself, that
even the Widow Barlow was not so utterly,
so irrevocably bad as she might be after all.</p>

    CHAPTER XII<br />
    Hadley gets better Acquainted with Col. Knowles
    </h3>

<h4>SYNOPSIS OF PREVIOUS CHAPTERS.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The story opens in the year 1777, during one
of the most critical periods of the Revolution.
Hadley Morris, our hero, is in the employ of Jonas
Benson, the host of the Three Oaks, a well-known
inn on the road between Philadelphia and New
York. Like most of his neighbors, Hadley is an
ardent sympathizer with the American cause. When,
therefore, he is intrusted with a message to be forwarded
to the American headquarters, the boy gives
up, for the time, his duties at the Three Oaks and
sets out for the army. Here he remains until after
the fateful Battle of Brandywine. On the return
journey he discovers a party of Tories who have
concealed themselves in a woods in the neighborhood
of his home. By approaching cautiously to the
group around the fire, Hadley overhears their plan
to attack his uncle for the sake of the gold which
he is supposed to have concealed in his house.</p>
</div>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE words Brace Alwood uttered were
enough to rivet Hadley to the spot,
and, almost within a long arm reach
of the men lounging about the fire, he
crouched and listened to the dialogue which
followed. The reason stated by Brace for
the presence of the Tories in this place
naturally startled and horrified Ephraim
Morris’s nephew. When the old man was
well-known to be a strong Royalist, why
should these fellows be plotting to attack
him? At once Hadley was sure that they
were after the money which rumor said
Miser Morris kept concealed in his house.</p>

<p>Remembering the incident of the night at
his uncle’s house, Hadley doubted if the
men would gain what they hoped for; but
Uncle Ephraim was old and alone, and
there was no telling what these rough fellows
might do to gain their ends.</p>

<p>“You’d better make sure the old man is
alone, Alwood,” suggested one of the
others, as Brace and his younger brother
took seats in the circle around the fire.
“There used to be a boy with Miser Morris&mdash;his
nevvy, was it?&mdash;who might make
us trouble.”</p>

<p>Brace Alwood laughed harshly. “We
ought to be a match for an old man and a
boy, I reckon&mdash;though Lon, here, tells me
Had Morris is pretty sharp.”</p>

<p>“He made me and Black Sam pole him
across the river one night when he was carrying
dispatches to the army,” Lon admitted.
“An’ he pretty near broke my arm
just before he left these parts last, too.”</p>

<p>“What army was he carrying dispatches
to?” demanded the first speaker.</p>

<p>“Washington’s, of course.”</p>

<p>“But the old man is for the king, you
say&mdash;worse luck!”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t say the boy is,” Brace remarked.
“He’s a perky lad, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“He may do us harm, then&mdash;in slipping
away and rousin’ the farmers, I mean.”</p>

<p>“He’s with the army now,” said Lon.</p>

<p>“And there’s nobody with the old man?”</p>

<p>“Not a soul.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll likely have an easy time of it.
If he’s got as much as they say hid away
in the house, this night’s work will pay
us fine.”</p>

<p>“And settle some old scores, too,” added
Brace. “Colonel Knowles will be revenged
on the old scoundrel, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I remember what you told us,”
said the first man, thoughtfully. “His
Honor is too loyal a man to appear in this
matter, though, I take it?”</p>

<p>Brace laughed shortly. “No doubt&mdash;no
doubt. He comes here to get something
out of Miser Morris; but the old fox gives
nothing away&mdash;not him!”</p>

<p>Hadley had heard enough to assure him
that the Tories were actually going to attack
his uncle, Royalist though he was.
With silent tread he crept
away from the place,
crossed the pasture to the
road, and getting on
Black Molly’s back, sent
her flying toward the inn.
He was fearful for Uncle
Ephraim’s safety, but it
was useless for him to ride
and warn the old man.
He must arouse the farmers&mdash;or
such of them as
were at home&mdash;and bring
a band to oppose the men
with Brace Alwood.
There would be some lack
of enthusiasm, however,
when it was learned that
the Tory renegades were
attacking one of their own
kind; it was a case of
“dog eat dog,” and most
of the neighbors would
scarce care if the old man
was robbed.</p>

<p>But Hadley rode swiftly
toward the Three Oaks
Inn, determined to raise
a rescuing party at all
hazard. It was evening
and the men usually centered
there to hear the
news and talk over the
war and kindred topics,
and the boy was quite
confident of getting some
help. Besides, what he had heard while
lying hidden in the grove made him
believe that Colonel Creston Knowles
was partly the cause of this cowardly attack
by the Tories upon Uncle Ephraim,
and if the British officer was still at the
inn the boy determined that he should not
go unpunished for instigating the crime.</p>

<p>The American farmers about the inn had
borne with the British officer more because
he was Jonas Benson’s guest than aught
else. Before being sent by Lafe Holdness
on this last errand to the army, Hadley
knew that many of the neighbors spoke
threateningly of the British officer, who,
apparently, knew no fear even in an enemy’s
country. If they should be stirred up
now, after the disaster to the American
forces, when feeling would be sure to run
high, Colonel Knowles would find himself
in very dangerous quarters. For the moment
Hadley did not think of the danger
to Mistress Lillian. He was only anxious
for his uncle’s safety and enraged at Colonel
Knowles for the part he believed the officer
had in the plot to rob&mdash;and perhaps injure&mdash;the
farmer.</p>

<p>In an hour, so Brace Alwood said, they
would attack the lonely homestead of the
man whom the whole countryside believed
to be a miser. Hadley had good reason to
know that his uncle was possessed of much
wealth, whether rightfully or not did not
enter into the question now; but the money
was no longer in the house&mdash;of that he
was confident. Enraged at not finding it,
the Tories might seriously injure Ephraim
Morris. With these tumultuous thoughts
filling his brain, the boy rode into the inn
yard, let Black Molly find her old stall herself,
and was on the steps of the inn before
those in the kitchen had time to open the
door, aroused though they had been by the
rattle of the mare’s hoofs.</p>

<p>“It’s a courier!” cried some one.
“What’s the news?”</p>

<p>“It’s that Hadley Morris!” exclaimed
Mistress Benson, showing little cordiality
in her welcome. Jonas was not in evidence,
and there was no other men in the
kitchen.</p>

<p>“Where is Master Benson, madam?” demanded
Hadley of the innkeeper’s wife. “I
want him to help me&mdash;and all other true
men in the neighborhood. There is a
party of Tories up the road yonder, and
they are going to attack Uncle Ephraim’s
house and rob him this very night.”</p>

<p>“Tories!” gasped the maids.</p>

<p>“King’s men!” exclaimed Mistress Benson.
“And why should they wish to plague
Master Morris, Hadley? He is loyal.”</p>

<p>“That Brace Alwood is at their head.
They are bent on robbery. Nobody will be
safe now, if they overrun the country.
Where is Master Benson, I say?”</p>

<p>“He is gone to Trenton,” declared one
of the frightened women. “There is no
man here but Colonel Knowles’ servant.”</p>

<p>“Then he is here yet?” cried the boy, and
pushing through the group of women, he
entered the long hall which ran through the
inn from the kitchen to the main entrance.
His coming had evidently disturbed the
guests. Colonel Knowles stood in the hall
by the parlor door, a candlestick held above
his head that the light might be cast along
the passage, his daughter, clinging to his
sleeve, stood behind him.</p>

<p>“Whom have we here?” demanded the
British officer.</p>

<p>“It is Hadley Morris, father!” exclaimed
the girl, first to recognize the youth.</p>

<p>Hadley approached without fear, for his
indignation was boundless. “It is I,
Colonel Knowles,” he said, his voice quivering
with anger. “I have come back just in
time to find that, unable to bring my uncle
to such terms as you thought right, you
have set Brace Alwood and his troop of
villainous Tories upon the old man. But
I tell you, sir, I will arouse the neighborhood,
and if Uncle Ephraim is injured, you
shall be held responsible!”</p>

<p>The officer took a stride forward and
seized the boy by the arm. He waved the
crowd of women back. “Return to your
work!” he commanded. “Mistress Benson,
call William.” Then he said to
Hadley: “Master Morris, step into the
parlor here and tell me what you mean.
I am in the dark.”</p>

<p>Hadley began to think that perhaps he
had been too hasty in his judgment. He
stepped within the room. He did not speak
to the officer’s daughter, but she stared at
him with wide open, wondering eyes.
Then in a few sentences he told how he had
discovered the plot against his uncle.</p>

<p>“Who are these Alwoods?” demanded
the Colonel, when he had finished.</p>

<p>“Alonzo Alwood is the boy who came
here once to see you, father,” Lillian interposed,
before Hadley could reply. “Do
you not remember? He told you that
Master Morris was about to carry dispatches
to Mr. Washington again, and
asked you to help stop him in his journey.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed Hadley. “He did try
to halt me. But your servant, sir, stopped
him. Have I to thank&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Mistress Lillian, sir,” said the Colonel,
shortly, but a smile quivered about his
mouth. “I am in the enemy’s country, as
you advised me once, Master Morris, and
I would not be a party to the young man’s
plan. So this Brace Alwood is his
brother?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And they connect my name with their
raid upon that&mdash;that old man?”</p>

<p>“They do, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then to prove to you, Master Morris,
that I am not in their confidence, or they
in mine, I will ride back with you.” At
the instant the man-servant entered.
“William, saddle my horse and one of the
bays for yourself&mdash;instantly! I will join
you at once, Master Morris. If you
have other men in the neighborhood on
whom you can depend in this emergency,
arouse them.”</p>

<p>Hadley, feeling that his impulsiveness
had caused him to accuse Colonel Knowles
wrongfully, ran out again without a word.
While William, as silent as ever, saddled
the officer’s black charger and another animal
for himself, the boy took the saddle off
Black Molly and threw it upon one of the
other horses in the stable. Then he clattered
over to the nearest neighbor’s house
and routed out the family. But the only
men folk at home were two half-grown
boys, and when their mother learned that
there were Tories in the neighborhood she
refused to allow them to leave her and the
younger children. So he rode on to the
next homestead and brought back with him
to the inn but one man to join the party.
Colonel Knowles and his servant were
awaiting their coming in the road before
the door of the Three Oaks.</p>

<p>“Lead on, Master Morris!” commanded
the officer. “You know the way by night
better than I.”</p>

<p>“But there are only four of us,” began
Hadley, doubtfully.</p>

<p>“We can wait for no more if what you
have told me is true. They will be attacking
the old man by now.”</p>

<p>The quartette rode off at a gallop and
little was said until they turned into the
farm path which led through the pastures
and fields to the Morris homestead. Then
the neighbor was riding nearest Hadley’s
side and he whispered: “Hey, Morris, suppose
this should be a trap? Suppose the
Britisher should be playing us false?”</p>

<p>Hadley tapped the butt of the pistol beneath
his coat. “Then he’ll get what’s in
this first&mdash;and do you take William,” the
boy whispered. “But I do not believe
Colonel Knowles will play us false. These
Tory blackguards are nothing to him.”</p>

<p>The ring of the horses’ hoofs announced
their coming before they were within shot
of the house, around which the rascals
under Brace Alwood had assembled. But
no shots were fired, for Colonel Knowles
was ahead and his mount was recognized
by Lon in the light of the huge bonfire
which had been built in front of the farmer’s
door. Part of the Tories were already
inside the house, ransacking the
dwelling from cellar to garret, while
Ephraim was tied hard and fast to one of
his own chairs, and Brace Alwood, with
cruel delight in the farmer’s terror, was
threatening to hold the old man’s feet in
the flames on the hearth if he did not divulge
the hiding place of his gold. Colonel
Knowles’ coming struck the entire party of
marauders dumb.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here, you scoundrels?”
exclaimed the officer, almost riding
into the farmhouse in his rage, and laying
about him with the riding whip he carried.</p>

<p>The men shrank away in confusion.
Even Brace Alwood, the bully, was cowed.
“The old miser’s got more money than is
good for him,” whined Alwood. “And his
nephew is off with the rebels&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Sirrah!” exclaimed the colonel, sharply.
“Here is his nephew with me. And it matters
not what his nephew may be, in any
case; the man himself is for King George,
God bless him!&mdash;or so I understand.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, Master!” squealed the farmer
from the chair where he was tied. “I am
for the king. I told these villains I was
for the king. It is an outrage. I cannot
help what my rascally nephew is&mdash;I am
loyal.”</p>

<p>“And as for his money,” continued the
colonel, savagely, “you’d work hard and
long before you got any of it&mdash;and what
you got would likely not be his, but belong
to those whom he has robbed!” At that
Uncle Ephraim recognized his rescuer, and
he relapsed into frightened silence. “Come
out of that house and go about your business!”
commanded the officer. “Let me not
find any of you in this neighborhood in the
morning; and think not I shall forget this
escapade. Your colonel shall hear of it,
Alwood.”</p>

<p>Somebody released the farmer from his
uncomfortable position, and he followed the
bushwhackers to the door, bemoaning his
fate. The men clattered out and, evidently
fearing the power of Colonel Knowles, hurried
away toward the river. When Uncle
Ephraim saw his woodpile afire, he rushed
out and began pulling from the flames such
sticks as had only been charred, or were
burning at one end, all the time railing at
the misfortune that had overtaken him.
The neighbor looked on a minute and then
said, brusquely:</p>

<p>“I’ve little pity in my heart for such as
you, neighbor Morris&mdash;a man that will take
sides against his country.”</p>

<p>“And I’ve little pity for you, either,”
Colonel Knowles declared, when the first
speaker had ridden away, “for you are a
dishonest old villain!”</p>

<p>He and William wheeled their horses and
followed the bridle path back to the highway;
but Hadley, much troubled by what
he had heard, remained to help put out the
fire in the woodpile. His uncle did not
speak to him, however, but when the last
spark was quenched by the water which the
boy brought from the well, he went into
the house and, fairly shutting the door in
his nephew’s face, locked and barred it!</p>

<p>“Well!” muttered Hadley, “I don’t need
a kick to follow that hint that my company’s
not wanted,” and he rode back to the inn,
feeling very sorrowful. Evidently his uncle
was angry with him. But more than all
else was he troubled by the words he had
heard Colonel Knowles address to Ephraim
Morris. The British officer had broadly
intimated that the farmer was a thief!</p>

<p>On his return to the inn he was so tired
that he did not think of supper, and, instead
of going into the house, tumbled into his
couch in the loft and dropped to sleep
almost instantly. The next morning Master
Benson did not arrive, and the mistress
of the inn met Hadley with a very sour face
and berated him well for the manner in
which he had burst in upon her guests the
night before.</p>

<p>“You are spending more than half your
time with Washington’s ragamuffin army,”
quoth she; “you’d better stay with them
altogether. I cannot have my guests disturbed
and troubled by such as you.”</p>

<p>Hadley was inclined to take her berating
good-naturedly, for he knew at heart that
she was a kindly woman, and that, when
Jonas was at home, she would not dare talk
so. But she had really engaged a neighbor
to perform his tasks, and, learning that
Jonas was not expected back for a week or
more, Hadley saw that it was going to be
very unpleasant for him in the neighborhood
meanwhile. Even his uncle did not
care for his company, and he could not eat
the bread of idleness at the Three Oaks Inn.
There were three or four men starting to
join Washington’s forces, and he determined
to accompany them, sorry now that
he had returned at all.</p>

<p>He did not feel at liberty to take one of
the Bensons’ horses this time, and so started
afoot for the vicinity of Philadelphia. The
roads were full of refugee families, and,
although he could not learn of any real
battle having been fought, the country people
had evidently lost all hope of Washington
staying the advance of the British.
Hadley and his comrades traveled briskly,
reaching the vicinity of Warren’s Inn early
on the morning of the 16th and joined General
Wayne’s forces just as the downpour
of rain which spoiled the operations of that
day began.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />
WITH “MAD ANTHONY” WAYNE</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>N this 16th day of September, the opposing
forces&mdash;Howe’s army led by
Lord Cornwallis and the Americans
by Anthony Wayne&mdash;met in conflict near
the Warren Inn. Since Brandywine, when,
because of Sullivan’s defeat, Washington
had been forced to retreat to Chester, the
armies had been maneuvering on the Lancaster
pike; but nothing more serious than
skirmishes had resulted. But this conflict
near the old inn was a close and sharp engagement,
and it would have been general
had not the rain which was falling become
a veritable deluge. The arms and ammunition
were rendered almost useless, and the
Americans had to retreat again.</p>

  <div class="caption">WAYNE QUICKLY RALLIED HIS MEN
  </div>
</div>

<p>Bitterly did Hadley Morris grieve as,
through the mud and downpour, he trudged
in the ranks of his countrymen. Somebody
sought him out on the march. It was Captain
Prentice, relieved for the time of his
command because of his wound; yet he had
been near all day to encourage the men and
was able still to wield his sword.</p>

<p>“Eh, boy, I knew you would come back!”
he said, smiling. “Your blood’s up, and
you’ll not sit at peace in the chimney-corner
till this bloody war is settled one way or
’tother.”</p>

<p>Hadley told him what had occurred at
his uncle’s house, and at the inn where he
worked. “You did right to come back to
fight with us,” Prentice said. “And you’ll
see fighting enough with ‘Mad Anthony.’
Where he goes there is fighting always&mdash;that
is his business. And a braver or better
general does not command on our side, despite
the slanders that are told about him.
Ah, Hadley, these adventurers and politicians
with His Excellency are what keep
us back. They so fear to see a good man
win that they will do all they can to ruin
him. Why, do you know, they are trying
to throw some of the blame for Sullivan’s
blunder, down there at Brandywine creek,
upon Anthony Wayne, although he fought
with all the stubbornness a man ever displayed,
and held off Knyphausen and his
Hessians all day&mdash;until, in fact, he learned
of the defeat in his rear, and that the rest
of the army was retreating.</p>

<p>“We were too busy ourselves that day,
Master Morris, to know much about what
went on excepting directly in front of us,”
Prentice continued, with a smile. “But
now that the matter is history, for history
is being made rapidly these days, we can
get at the truth pretty easily. Colonel Cadwalader,
who, by the way, has gone to
Philadelphia to look out for his private interests,
and several other officers, were discussing
the Brandywine engagement yesterday.
The colonel, naturally, is a strong
opponent of Sullivan and a warm adherent
of General Wayne, for the former has too
many political friends, and the latter is a
plain, out-and-out fighter. Wayne is a
Pennsylvania man, you know; has been a
farmer over near Easton ’most all his life&mdash;though
they do say he traveled north
once, surveying land. He is somewhere
about thirty-three years old now.</p>

<p>“He brought his own regiment into the
army&mdash;the Fourth Pennsylvania,” continued
the captain, getting away from the real
matter under discussion, but holding Hadley’s
attention, nevertheless, “and he has
been advanced to brigadier-general for
conspicuous gallantry. They call him ‘Mad
Anthony’ and claim he is reckless and
thoughtless; but it’s a pity we haven’t more
such mad men in the army. You have seen
to-day how the troops love him and what
they will do for him. This handful of
muddy, half-starved creatures would charge
the whole of Howe’s army if Anthony
Wayne were at their head! Did you get
a glimpse of him to-day, Morris?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. And I think him a fine figure
of a man,” declared the boy, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“He is that, indeed. A man of more
forceful facial expression I never saw, and
his dark eyes are always sparkling&mdash;either
in fun or with earnestness. Anthony
Wayne is an ‘all or nothing’ man&mdash;he is
never lukewarm, as are some of these fellows
who have obtained their commissions
from Congress. What if he does brag?
Why, Morris, if we’d done what he has, and
were masters of the science of war as he is,
we’d brag ourselves!”</p>

<p>“But why do they try to drag him into
the trouble over the Brandywine defeat?”
queried the boy.</p>

<p>“Why? Ask me why a mangy, homeless
cur always snarls at the heels of a dog that
is well bred. ’Tis always so. Jealousy is
at the bottom of all these cabals and plots
with which the army is troubled. Even His
Excellency is not free from the arrows of
their hate. And, as I tell you, Sullivan has
too many political friends. They wish to
attract attention from his mistakes to somebody
else, and they fall upon General
Wayne and call him reckless. Reckless,
forsooth! His fighting that day when he
faced those Hessians was marvelous.</p>

<p>“Nobody,” pursued Prentice, warmly,
“unless it was His Excellency himself,
realized how exceedingly well placed my
Lord Howe’s troops were for defence on
the left bank of the Brandywine. Greene
selected our position&mdash;the position of the
main army. I mean, at Chadd’s Ford&mdash;and
it was well. Wayne was there. Sullivan,
as the senior Major-General, commanded
the left wing. Wayne’s line was three
miles long, and the farthest crossing, which
he did not cover, Sullivan was supposed to
watch.</p>

<p>“You and I, Morris, were too busy in our
little corner to know these facts at that time.
But it has all come out now, and, just because
a certain Major Spear was either a
fool or a coward, Sullivan’s flank was
turned and the army routed.”</p>

<p>“What had Major Spear to do with it?”
asked Hadley, interested despite the mud
and rain through which they continued to
plod.</p>

<p>“I’ll explain. Early on the day of the
battle,&mdash;the 11th, you know,&mdash;Howe and
Cornwallis marched for the forks of the
Brandywine, where there are easy fords.
Evidently they intended to do exactly what
they did do&mdash;cross the river and march
down on our side, doubling Sullivan’s wing
back upon the main army. For a maneuver
in broad daylight it was childish; but it won
because of this man Spear.</p>

<p>“Colonel Bland had been ordered to cross
at Jones’ Ford to find out what the British
were about. He sent back word&mdash;there
can be no doubt of this, although Sullivan’s
friends have tried to deny it&mdash;that Cornwallis
was surely marching for the upper
crossings. His Excellency, learning of this
report, threw Wayne across the river to
attack Grant and Knyphausen, while Sullivan
and Greene were to engage the flanking
column of Britishers. Why, if things
had gone right, we’d have cut the two divisions
of the enemy to pieces!” declared
the captain, bitterly.</p>

<p>“But it was not to be. A part of
Wayne’s troops had already forded the
river when this Major Spear, who had been
reconnoitering in the direction of the forks,
reported no sign of the enemy in that direction.
What the matter was with the
man I don’t know&mdash;nobody seems to know;
but Sullivan should have known whether
he was to be trusted or not. The general,
on his own responsibility, halted his column
and sent word to His Excellency that the
first report of the British movements was
wrong&mdash;Cornwallis was not in the vicinity
of the Brandywine forks. Naturally this
put the Commander-in-Chief out, and, fearing
a surprise, he withdrew Wayne’s men
from across the river. The Hessians followed;
but they got no farther. Mad Anthony
held them in check.</p>

<p>“While we were fighting so hard down
there by Chadd’s Ford, Sullivan was doing
nothing at all. About one o’clock, it seems,
a man named Cheney rode into Sullivan’s
division and reported that the British had
crossed the river and had reached the Birmingham
meeting-house. That was some
distance then on Sullivan’s right. But the
general still stuck to his belief in Major
Spear, and instead of sending out a scouting
party, put aside the report as valueless.</p>

<p>“This ’Squire Cheney is something of a
man in his township&mdash;lives over Thornbury
way, they tell me&mdash;and it angered him to
be treated so superciliously by Sullivan.
So what does he do but spur on to headquarters
and inform General Washington
himself. The report could scarcely be believed
by the Commander-in-Chief and his
staff, and you cannot blame them. Everybody
knew how much depended on the day’s
action, and that Sullivan should make such
a terrible blunder was past belief.</p>

<p>“Your friend Colonel Cadwalader told
me about it afterward. ‘If you doubt my
word, put me under arrest until you can
ask Anthony Wayne or Persie Frazer if
I am a man to be believed!’ said Cheney,
getting red in the face. The staff&mdash;some
of the young men, it seemed&mdash;had laughed
at the queer figure the old fellow cut on his
horse. ‘I’d have you know that I have this
day’s work as much at heart as e’er a one
of ye!’ quoth Cheney, and at that His Excellency
ordered a change of face, and part
of the army moved up to the support of
Sullivan.</p>

<p>“You know what happened after that.
You saw the fugitives and the wounded
when you rode to Philadelphia, Hadley.
It was a sad day, and all because one man
made a mistake,&mdash;either foolishly or willfully,&mdash;and
another man did not consider
the fate of the first city in the land of sufficient
importance to have every report
brought to him corroborated. Sullivan
must bear the brunt of this thing,&mdash;as his
men bore the brunt of the enemy’s charge&mdash;because
he was in command at that end of
the line. But they’re trying to make out
that Anthony Wayne could have saved the
day with his troops had he wished. They’d
not talk so bold had they faced those
bloody Hessians as we did.”</p>

<p>“It seems awful that there should be
friction in an army of patriots,” Hadley
said, thoughtfully. “They are all patriotic&mdash;they
all desire the freedom of the Colonies.”</p>

<p>“What some of them desire it would be
hard to say,” declared Prentice, gloomily.
“And we are not patriots until we win.
We’re rebels now&mdash;and rebels we shall go
down into history unless the Great Jehovah
Himself shall strike for us and give us a
lasting victory over the British. I tell you,
boy, I am discouraged.”</p>

<p>And it was a discouraged column of 1,500
men who marched that night to Tredyfrrin,
where Wayne had been ordered by the
Commander-in-Chief “to watch the movements
of the enemy, and, when joined by
Smallwood and the Maryland militia, to cut
off their baggage and hospital trains.”</p>

<p>On the 19th, after waiting in vain for
Smallwood’s reinforcements, Wayne again
crossed the river, and was, at Paoli, able to
advance within half a mile of Howe’s encampment.
He reported to General Washington
that the enemy was then quietly
washing and cooking. The British seemed
to consider this advance on Philadelphia
more in the light of a picnicing party than
anything else. To his commander, however,
Wayne said that the enemy was too
compactly massed to be openly attacked by
his small force, and begged that the entire
army might come to his aid and strike a
heavy blow. But neither Smallwood’s
brigade nor any other division of the American
forces arrived to aid the little party at
Paoli on that day, nor the one following.</p>

<p>Scouts brought in the tale that Howe was
about to take up his line of march, and so,
as the night of the 20th drew near, Wayne
determined to attack in any case, reinforcements
or not. The watchword that night in
the American camp was, “Here we are and
there they go!” and the troops were eager
to follow their beloved leader into the very
heart of the British encampment. It was
believed that the night attack was unsuspected
by the British, but it proved later
that vigilant Tories had wormed the information
from somebody on Wayne’s staff
and hastened with it to the British camp.</p>

<p>So confident was Wayne that his plans
were unsuspected that, when informed by
a friendly citizen, between nine and ten in
the evening, that a boy of the neighborhood,
who had been in the British camp during
the day, had overheard a soldier say that
“an attack on the American party would be
made during the night,” Mad Anthony
would not credit it. It did not seem probable
that if such an attack was being considered
by the British leaders, it would be
common camp talk.</p>

<p>However, believing that surplus precaution
would do no harm, he multiplied his
pickets and patrols and ordered the troops
to repose on their arms, and, as it was then
raining, made the men put their ammunition
under their coats. He was thus prepared to
meet an attack or withdraw, as circumstances
might direct.</p>

<p>Ere this, Captain Prentice had been sent
to headquarters, almost by force, indeed,
because his wound had become inflamed,
and Hadley, being simply a volunteer, was
obliged to take pot-luck where he found it,
and was even without a blanket or pouch
in which to carry his rations. He would
have been more comfortable on picket duty
that night, only volunteers were not trusted
in such serious matters; and perhaps, if
he had been, the youth would not have
gotten out of the terrible engagement
alive.</p>

<p>Somewhere about eleven o’clock, rumor
had it that the British were on the move.
Wayne believed that the enemy would
attack his right flank, and immediately ordered
Colonel Humpton, his second in command,
to wheel his line and move off by
the road leading to the White Horse Tavern.
Meanwhile, General Gray, in command
of three British regiments and some
dragoons with Tory guides, approached
Paoli. The British were ordered to withhold
their fire and to depend altogether on
the bayonet. At midnight, two hours
before the time fixed for his own advance
on Howe’s force, Wayne learned that his
pickets had been surprised.</p>

<p>Colonel Humpton had not obeyed, nor
did he do so until the third order reached
him. The artillery moved without loss or
injury, but the remainder of the army was
in confusion, and, when charged by the
British, the affair became almost a rout.
An English officer who was present at the
attack afterward wrote:</p>

<p>“It was a dreadful scene of havoc. The
Americans were easily distinguished by the
light of the camp fires as they fell into line,
thus offering Gray’s men an advantage.
The charge was furious, and all Wayne’s
efforts to rally his men were useless. They
were driven through the woods two miles,
and nearly a hundred and seventy men were
killed.”</p>

<p>With those about him, inspired as they
were with fear of the bayonet, and confused
by the darkness, Hadley Morris ran blindly
through the woods to escape the death
which followed him. The awful sabre-like
bayonets of the British muskets he did
escape; but a half-spent ball imbedded itself
in the flesh of his leg above the knee and
brought him at last to earth. The others
streamed by and left him. He feared he
would be captured and perhaps sent to the
prison hulks in New York Bay; but both
pursued and pursuer passed him by, and he
was saved in the darkness.</p>

<p>He could not travel with the ball in his
leg, and so he lay down again under some
bushes, and, despite the wound and his
fright, dropped off into slumber, and slept
just as soundly as he would had war and
bloodshed been farthest from his thoughts.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak sans-serif" id="MIDSUMMER_DAYS">MIDSUMMER DAYS
  </h2>

<p class="smcap h2sub">By Julia McNair Wright</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE production of seed is the chief
object of plant life. Upon this depends
the continuance of the vegetable
world, and therefore all animal existence.
From the elephant to the mouse,
from the whale to the minnow, from the
eagle to the humming-bird, life is conditioned
upon the constant return of “the
herb-bearing fruit whose seed is in itself.”</p>

<p>In every minute particular the flower is
constructed to insure the production of
sound seed. The first form of this seed is
the tiny ovule in the germ. Ovules cannot
grow into seeds, unless they are brought in
contact with the pollen, which must arrive
at them by way of the stigma.</p>

<p>The pollen of flowers is a most fine, delicate
dust. It must be conveyed without
injury in the most delicate manner. Many
flowers are exceedingly high up, as on
climbing vines, or growing on tree-tops,
peaks, or house-tops. Many other plants
are very low down, lying close to the
ground, as the bluets, chickweed, arbutus,
partridge-berry, and others. A large number
of plants are in positions inaccessible to
man or the larger animals.</p>

<p>Man excepted, the larger animals seem
generally to have a destructive mission to
plants, devouring, breaking, or trampling
down. Men themselves are often ruthless
destroyers of beautiful plants, and seem
to care for and conserve only what concerns
human convenience.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have the problem of plants
fixed in their places, needing carriers for
their pollen to distant plants of their own
kind, at the exact period of maturity. The
carriers must be able to go high or low, into
all manner of different localities; they must
be delicately made, so that they will not
injure the plants which they visit, capable
of carrying the frail pollen grains unharmed,
and they must have some object
of their own in these visitations, which shall
infallibly secure their doing of the work required.
Finally, let us remember that the
pollen of flowers is but seldom spread where
it is easy to secure it. The buttercup lavishly
expends a golden saucer of pollen; the
lily has a wide-open door, near which hangs
the antlers, like so many ready bells. On
the other hand, how long and narrow are
the throats of the morning-glories and
honeysuckles; how tiny are the tubes of
mint, thyme, and clover; how fast-closed is
the mouth of the snap-dragon; how narrow
the fox-glove’s throat. Pollen-carriers
must be able to secure the dust so jealously
kept, and must be afforded a reward for
their trouble.</p>

<p>What form of animal life meets all these
conditions? But one&mdash;the insect. It is
generally light and delicate in structure,
active, winged; its life is conterminous with
that of flowers; they are spring and summer
guests. The slender shape and the long,
slim mouth organs of the insect can penetrate
and gently force open flower tubes and
the fast-shut lips of corollas; the velvet
coats and fine, waving antennæ will receive
and carry uninjured the precious dust, and
the insect habit of constant roaming from
bloom to bloom assures the accomplishment
of its important errand.</p>

<p>Not all insects, but a few widely-distributed
families, are the chosen partners
of the flowers; these are the various tribes
of bees, moths, and butterflies, with some
help from a few others.</p>

<p>“Nothing for nothing” seems to be a law
of nature. What does the flower offer to
the insect for its services as pollen distributer?
Honey, which is the chief food
of flying insects, also wax, and pollen for
its private use at home. The miller, we
know, takes toll from the flour he grinds.</p>

<p>To secure insect visitants, the flower provides
honey; almost all flowers secrete some
dainty juices. As shopkeepers set up signs
to inform the public of their wares, so the
flowers hang forth signs; these are the brilliant
corollas, or parts highly colored which
take the place of
corollas.</p>

<p>Another bid
for visits is
made by perfume,
which attracts
insects as
being generally
associated with
honey. Many
flowers have inconspicuous
corollas,
or are
hidden under
foliage, or so
placed as to risk
being neglected;
these call attention
by fragrance,
as the
mignonette, the
violet, or arbutus.
Others, as
the lilies, have
large and attractive
corollas,
yet add perfume
to size and
color, to insure
the securing of insect attention and help.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp62" id="i_180" style="max-width: 39.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_180.jpg" alt="Flowers with insects flying around them." />
  <div class="caption"><p>PLANTS AND THEIR PARTNERS</p></div>
</div>

<p>Plants which depend upon moths, or any
night-flying insects, have usually strong
perfume and pale color, as white or light
lemon color, which can easily be seen in
twilight. The odor attracts the insect in its
direction; and on a nearer approach the
flower is seen.</p>

<p>Most flowers have peculiarly bright
streaks, spots, or other markings, in the
direction of the honey, and the honey is
placed at the bottom of the stamens, thus
the insect is attracted just where he should
go. The tiger lily has its startling red spots;
the arum its lines of red and green; the
morning-glory its vivid stripes, the jonquil
its ruffled bi-colored crown, and the beauty-of-the-night
its bright purple centre.</p>

<p>When the
pollen is ripe
for carrying, all
the parts of the
flower are at
their best: the
perfume is the
strongest, the
coloring the
brightest, the
nectar most
abundant.</p>

<p>On these hot
July days, when
the sun draws
out the richest
fragrance and
lights up the
most brilliant
colors, watch
the bees and
butterflies. The
bee seeks the
clover on one
trip, mignonette
on another,
lilies on a third.
The butterflies
have no hive returning
to mark their work, but you can
count their visits, a dozen or more to
flowers of one kind before they investigate
the sweets of flowers of some other

<h4>SYNOPSIS OF PREVIOUS CHAPTERS.</h4>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Brought up in the forests of northern Maine, and
seeing few persons excepting her uncle and Angelique,
the Indian housekeeper, Margot Romeyn knows
little of life beyond the deep hemlocks. Naturally
observant, she is encouraged in her out-of-door
studies by her uncle, at one time a college professor.
Through her woodland instincts, she and her uncle
are enabled to save the life of Adrian Wadislaw,
a youth who, lost and almost overcome with hunger,
has been wandering in the neighboring forest. To
Margot the new friend is a welcome addition to her
small circle of acquaintances, and after his rapid
recovery she takes great delight in showing him the
many wonders of the forest about her home.
But finally, after many weeks, the uncle decides,
because of reasons which will be known later, that
it would be better for Margot if Adrian left them.
Accordingly, he puts the matter before the young
man, who, although reluctant to leave his new
friends, volunteers to go. Under the guidance of
Pierre Ricord, a young Indian, the lad sets out for
the nearest settlement. Once in the woods, however,
they decide to remain there for a while. During
their wanderings the two had become separated
for a time and then it is that Adrian hears a noise
which makes his pulse beat faster. It is the call of
a moose.</p>
</div>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>UT Pierre, also, had heard that distant
“Ugh-u-u-ugh!” and instantly paused.</p>

<p>His own anxiety was lest Adrian
should not hear and be still. Fortunately,
the wind was in their favor and the sensitive
nostrils of the moose less apt to scent
them. Having listened a moment, he
dropped his pack so softly that, heavy as it
was, it scarcely made the undergrowth
crack. His gun was always loaded, and,
now making it ready for prompt use, he
started back toward his companion. The
Indian in his nature came to the fore. His
step was alert, precise, and light as that of
any four-footed forester. When within
sight of the other lad, listening and motionless,
his eye brightened.</p>

<p>“If he keeps that way, maybe&mdash;Ah!”</p>

<p>The moose call again, but farther off.
This was a disappointment, but they were
on good ground for hunting and another
chance would come. Meanwhile, they
would better make all haste to the thoroughfare.
There would be the better place,
and out in the canoe they’d have a wider
range.</p>

<p>“Here, you. Give me the boat. Did
you hear it?”</p>

<p>“Did I not? But you had the gun!”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t have made any difference if
you’d had it. Too far off. Let’s get on.”</p>

<p>Adrian lifted the pack and dropped it in
disgust. “I can’t carry that load!”</p>

<p>Pierre was also disgusted&mdash;by the other’s
ignorance and lack of endurance.</p>

<p>“What you don’t know about the woods
beats all. Haven’t you seen anybody pack
things before? I’ll show you. When
there’s big game handy is no time to quarrel.
If a pack’s too heavy, halve it. Watch
and learn something.”</p>

<p>Pierre could be both swift and dexterous
if he chose, and he rapidly unrolled and
divided the contents of the cotton tent.
Putting part into the blanket, he retied the
rest in the sheeting, and now neither bundle
was a very severe tax.</p>

<p>“Whew! What’s the sense of that? It’s
the same weight. How does ‘halving’ it
help?”</p>

<p>Pierre swung the canoe upon his head
and directed:</p>

<p>“Catch hold them straps. Carry one a
few rods. Drop it. Come back after the
other. Carry that a ways beyond the first.
Drop it. Get number one. All time lap
over, beyond, over, beyond. So.”</p>

<p>With a stick he illustrated upon the
ground, and, wasting no further time nor
speech, clasped his gun the tighter under his
arm and trotted forward again.</p>

<p>Adrian obeyed instructions, and though it
seemed, at first, a waste to go back and
forth along the carry as he had been directed,
found that, in the end, he had accomplished
his task with small fatigue or
delay.</p>

<p>“Another bit of woodcraft for my knowledge
box. Useful elsewhere, too. Wish I
could get through this country as fast as
Pierre does. But he’ll have to wait for me,
anyway.”</p>

<p>For a time Adrian could easily trace the
route of his guide by the bruises the canoe
had given the leaves and undergrowth; but
after a while the forest grew more open and
this trail was lost. Then he stopped to consider.
He had no intention of losing himself
again.</p>

<p>“We are aiming for the south. Good.
All the big branches of these hemlocks point
that way&mdash;so yonder’s my way. Queer,
too, how mossy the tree trunks are on the
north side. I’ve heard that you could
drop an Indian anywhere, in any forest, and
he’d travel to either point of the compass
he desired with nothing to guide him but
his instinct. Wish I was an Indian!
Wish, rather, I had my own compass and
good outfit that went over in my canoe.
Hurrah! There’s a glimmer of water.
That’s the thoroughfare. Now a dash for
it!”</p>

<p>Adrian was proud of his new skill in finding
his way through a trackless forest, but,
though he duly reached the stream, he could
not for a time see anything of Pierre. He
did not wish to shout, lest the moose might
be near and take fright, but at last he did
give a faint halloo, and an answer came at
once. Then a boat shot out from behind a
clump of alders and made down the river
toward him.</p>

<p>The current was swift and strong, and
there was considerable poling to be done
before it touched the shore and Pierre
stepped out.</p>

<p>“I’ve been looking round. This is as good
a place to camp to-night as we’ll find.
Leave the things here, and might as well
get ready now. Then we can stay out all
day and come back when we like.”</p>

<p>“But I thought we were to go on up thoroughfare.
Why stop here at all? Other
camping places are easy to find.”</p>

<p>“Are they? Ask a few more questions.
Good many things go to making right sort
of camp. Dry ground, good water to
drink, firewood, poles&mdash;Oh! shucks! If
you don’t know, keep still and learn.”</p>

<p>This was excellent advice, and Adrian
was tired. He decided to trust to the other
lad’s common sense and larger experience,
and, having so decided, calmly stretched
himself out upon the level bank of the
stream and went to sleep.</p>

<p>Pierre’s temper rose still higher, and
after he had endured the sight of Adrian’s
indolence as long as possible he stepped to
the river and dipped a bucket of water.
Then he returned and quietly dashed it
over the drowsy lad. The effect was all
that Pierre desired.</p>

<p>“What did you do that for?”</p>

<p>“Take this axe and get to work. I’ve
chopped long enough. It’s my turn&mdash;or
would be, only I’m after moose.”</p>

<p>Adrian realized that he had given cause
for offense and laughed good-naturedly.
His nap had rested him much more than
his broken sleep of the night under the
rocks, and the word “moose” had an inspiration
all its own.</p>

<p>“I’ve cut the firewood. You get poles
for the tent. I’ll get things ready for
supper.”</p>

<p>Adrian laid his hand dramatically upon
his stomach. “I’ve an inner conviction
already that dinner precedes supper.”</p>

<p>“Cut, can’t you?”</p>

<p>“Cut it is.”</p>

<p>In a few moments he had chopped down
a few slender poles, and, selecting two with
forked branches, he planted these upright
on a little rise of the dryest ground.
Across the notches he laid a third pole, and
over this he stretched their strip of sheeting.
When this was pegged down at a convenient
angle at the back and also secured
at the ends, they had a very comfortable
shelter from the dew and possible rain.
The affair was open on one side, and before
this Pierre had heaped the wood for the fire
when they should return after the day’s
hunt. Together they cut and spread the
spruce and hemlock boughs for their bed,
arranging them in overlapping rows, with
an added quantity for pillows. Wrapped
in their blankets, for even at midsummer
these were not amiss, they hoped to sleep
luxuriously.</p>

<p>They stored their food in as safe a spot
as possible, though Pierre said that nothing
would molest it, unless it might be a hungry
hedgehog; but Adrian preferred to take no
risks. Then, with knives freshly sharpened
on the rocks, and the gun in hand, they
cautiously stepped into the canoe and
pushed off.</p>

<p>“One should not jump into a birch.
Easiest thing in the world to split the bottom,”
its owner had explained.</p>

<p>Adrian had no desire to do anything
that would hinder their success, therefore
submitted to his guide’s dictation with
a meekness that would have amused
Margot.</p>

<p>She would not have been amused by their
undertaking, nor its but half-anticipated
results. After a long and difficult warping-up
the rapids, in which Adrian’s skill
at using the sharp-pointed pole that helped
to keep the canoe off the rocks surprised
Pierre, they reached a dead water, with low,
rush-dotted banks.</p>

<p>“Get her into that cove yonder and keep
still. I’ve brought some bark and I’ll make
a horn.”</p>

<p>There, while they rested and listened,
Pierre deftly rolled his strip of birch bark
into a horn of two feet in length, small at
the mouth end, but several inches wide at
the other. He tied it with cedar thongs,
and, putting it to his lips, uttered a call so
like a cow moose that Adrian wondered
more and more.</p>

<p>“Hm-m! I thought I was pretty smart,
myself; but I’ll step down when you take
the stand.”</p>

<p>“Sh-h-h! Don’t move. Don’t speak.
Don’t breathe if you can help it.”</p>

<p>Adrian became rigid, all his faculties
merged in that one desire to lose no
sound.</p>

<p>Again Pierre gave the moose call, and&mdash;hark!
what was that? An answering cry,
a far-away crashing of boughs, the onrush
of some big creature, hastening to its
mate.</p>

<p>Noiselessly Pierre brought his gun into
position, sighting one distant point from
which he thought his prey would come.
Adrian’s body dripped with a cold sweat,
his hands trembled, specks floated before
his staring eyes, every nerve was tense,
and, as Margot would have said, he was
a-thrill “with murder,” from head to foot!
Oh! if the gun were his, and the
shot!</p>

<p>Another call, another cry, and a magnificent
head came into view. With horns
erect and quivering nostrils, the monarch
of that wilderness came, seeking love, and
faced his enemies.</p>

<p>“He’s within range&mdash;shoot!” whispered
Adrian.</p>

<p>“Only mad him that way. Sh! When
he turns&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Bang! bang! bang!” in swift succession.</p>

<p>The great horns tossed, the noble head
came round again, then bent, wavered, and
disappeared. The tragedy was over.</p>

<p>“I got him! I got him that time! Always
shoot that way, never&mdash;”</p>

<p>Pierre picked up his paddle and sent the
canoe forward at a leap. When there came
no responding movement from his companion
he looked back over his shoulder.
Adrian’s face had gone white, and the
eagerness of his eyes had given place to unspeakable
regret.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Sick?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Why, it was murder! Margot
was right.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shucks!”</p>

<p>Whereupon Pierre pulled the faster
toward the body of his victim.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br />
  <small>SHOOTING THE RAPIDS</small>
  </h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HREE months earlier, if anybody had
told Adrian he would ever be guilty
of such “squeamishness,” he would
have laughed in derision. Now, all unconsciously
to himself, the influence of his
summer at Peace Island was upon him, and
it came to him with the force of a revelation
that God had created the wild creatures of
His forests for something nobler than to become
the prey of man.</p>

<p>“Oh! That grand fellow! His splendidly
defiant, yet hopeless, facing of death!
I wish we’d never met him!”</p>

<p>“Well, of all fools! I thought you
wanted nothing but a chance at him yourself.”</p>

<p>“So I did, before I saw him. What if
it had been Madoc?”</p>

<p>“That’s different.”</p>

<p>“The same. Might have been twin
brothers. Maybe they were.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t have been. Paddle, won’t
you?”</p>

<p>Adrian did so, but with a poor grace.
He would now far rather have turned the
canoe about toward camp, yet railed at himself
for his sudden cowardice. He shrank
from looking on the dead moose as only an
hour before he had longed to do so.</p>

<p>They were soon at the spot where the
animal had disappeared, and, pushing the
boat upon the reedy shore, Pierre plunged
forward through the marsh. Adrian did
not follow, till a triumphant shout reached
him. Then he felt in his pocket and, finding
a pencil with a bit of paper, made his own
way more slowly to the side of his comrade,
who, wildly excited, was examining and
measuring his quarry. On a broad-leaved
rush he had marked off a hand’s width, and
from this unit calculated that:</p>

<p>“He’s eight feet four from hoof to shoulder,
and that betters the King by six inches.
See! His horns spread nigh six feet. If
he stood straight and held them up, he’d be
fifteen feet or nothing! They spread
more’n six feet, and, I tell you, he’s a
beauty!”</p>

<p>“Yes. He’s all of that. But of what
use is his beauty now?”</p>

<p>“Humph! Didn’t know you was a
girl!”</p>

<p>Adrian did not answer. He was rapidly
and skillfully sketching the prostrate animal,
and studying it minutely. From his
memory of it alive and the drawing, he
hoped to paint a tolerably lifelike portrait
of the animal; and a fresh inspiration came
to him. To those projected woodland pictures
he would add glimpses of its wild
denizens, and in such a way that the hearts
of the beholders should be moved to pity,
not to slaughter.</p>

<p>But, already, that sharpened knife of
Pierre’s was at work, defacing, mutilating.</p>

<p>“Why do that, man?”</p>

<p>“Why not? What ails you? What’d we
hunt for?”</p>

<p>“We don’t need him for food. You cannot
possibly carry those horns any distance
on our trip, and you’re not apt to come back
just this same way. Let him lie. You’ve
done him all the harm you should. Come
on. Is this like him?” and Adrian showed
his drawing.</p>

<p>“Oh! It’s like enough. If you don’t
relish my job, clear out. I can skin him
alone.”</p>

<p>Adrian waited no second bidding, but
strolled away to a distance and tried to
think of other things than the butchering in
progress. But at last Pierre whistled, and
he had to go back or else be left in the wilderness
to fare alone as best he might. It
was a ghastly sight. The great skin,
splashed and wet with its owner’s blood,
the dismembered antlers, the slashed-off
nose,&mdash;which such as Pierre considered a
precious tid-bit,&mdash;the naked carcass, and the
butcher’s own uninviting state.</p>

<p>“I declare, I can never get into the same
boat with you and all that horror. Do leave
it here. Do wash yourself,&mdash;there’s plenty
of water,&mdash;and let’s be gone.”</p>

<p>Pierre did not notice the appeal. Though
the lust of killing had died out of his eyes,
the lust of greed remained. Already he
was estimating the value of the hide, cured
or uncured, and the price those antlers
would bring could he once get them to the
proper market.</p>

<p>“Why, I’ve heard that in some of the
towns folks buy ’em to hang their hats on.
Odd! Lend a hand.”</p>

<p>Reluctantly, Adrian did lift his portion
of heavy horns and helped carry them to the
birch. He realized that the quickest way
of putting this disagreeable spot behind him
was by doing as he was asked. He was
hopeless of influencing the other by any
change in his own feelings, and wisely kept
silence.</p>

<p>But they hunted no more that day, nor
did they make any further progress on their
journey. Pierre busied himself in erecting
a rude frame, upon which he stretched the
moose skin to dry. He also prepared the
antlers and built a sort of hut, of saplings
and bark, where he could store his trophies
till his return trip.</p>

<p>“For I shall surely come back this same
way. It’s good hunting ground and moose
feed in herds. Small herds, course, but two
three make a fello’ rich. Eh?”</p>

<p>Adrian said nothing. He occupied himself
in what Pierre considered a silly
fashion, sketching, studying “effects,” and
carefully cutting big pieces of the birch bark
that he meant to use for canvas. To keep
this flat during his travels was a rather difficult
problem, but finally solved by cutting
two slabs of cedar wood and placing the
sheets of bark between these.</p>

<p>Whereupon Pierre laughed and assured
the weary chopper that he had had his
trouble for his pains.</p>

<p>“What for you want to carry big lumber
that way? Roll your bark. That’s all
right. When you want to use it, put it in
water. Easy. Queer how little you know
about things.”</p>

<p>“All right. I was silly, sure enough.
But thanks for your teaching. Maybe, if
you were in my city, I might show you a
thing or two.”</p>

<p>Both lads were glad, however, when night
came, and, having cooked themselves a
good supper and replenished their fire, they
slept as only such healthy lads can sleep; to
wake at sunrise, ready for fresh adventures,
and with the tragedy of the previous day
partly forgotten, even by Adrian. Then,
after a hearty breakfast, they resumed their
trip.</p>

<p>Nothing eventful occurred for some time
after. No more moose appeared, and, beyond
winging a duck or two and fishing
now and then, Pierre kept his hunting instincts
down. In fact, he was just then too
lazy to exert himself. He felt that he had
labored beyond all reason during the past
summer and needed a rest. Besides, were
not his wages steadily going on? If Adrian
was silly enough to paint and paint and
paint all day, this old tree and that mossy
stump, he was not responsible for another
man’s stupidity. Not he. The food was
still holding out, so let things take their
course.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, Adrian realized that
they were wasting time. He had made
sketches on everything and anything he
could find, and had accumulated enough
birch bark to swamp the canoe, should they
strike rough water; and far more than was
comfortable for him to carry over any portage.
So he one morning announced his intention
of leaving the wilderness and getting
back to civilization.</p>

<p>“All right. I go with you. Show me
the town, then I’ll come back.”</p>

<p>“Well, as you please. Only I don’t propose
to pay you any longer than will take
us, now by the shortest road, to Donovan’s.”</p>

<p>“Time enough to borrow that trouble
when you see it.”</p>

<p>But Pierre suggested that, as Adrian
wished to learn everything possible about
the woods, he should now take the guidance
of affairs, and that whenever things went
wrong, he, Pierre, could point the way.
He did this because, of late, he fancied that
his young employer had taken a “too top-lofty”
tone in addressing him; and, in truth,
Adrian’s day dreams of coming fame and
his own genius were making him feel vastly
superior to the rough woodsman.</p>

<p>They had paddled over dead water to a
point where two streams touched it, and the
question rose&mdash;which way?</p>

<p>“That!” said Adrian, with decision,
pointing to the broader and more southern
of the two.</p>

<p>“Good enough.”</p>

<p>For a moment the leader fancied there
was a gleam of malice in his hireling’s eye,
but he considered it beneath his notice and
calmly turned the canoe into the thoroughfare
he had chosen. It was wonderfully
smooth and delightful paddling. In all
their trip they had not found so level a
stream, and it was nothing but enjoyment
of the scenery that Adrian felt; until it
seemed to him that they had been moving
a long time without arriving anywhere.
“Haven’t we?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh! we’ll get there soon, now.”</p>

<p>Presently things began to look familiar.
There was one curiously-shaped, lightning-riven
pine, standing high above its fellows,
that appeared like an old friend.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s this? Can there be two
trees, exactly alike, within a half-day’s rowing?
I’ve certainly sketched that old landmark
from every side, and&mdash;Hello! yonder’s
my group of white birches, or I’m
blind. How queer!”</p>

<p>A few more sweeps and the remains of
the camp they had that morning left were
before them, and Pierre could no longer
repress his glee.</p>

<p>“Good guide, you! Trust a know-it-all
for a fool.”</p>

<p>“What does it mean?” demanded Adrian,
angrily.</p>

<p>“Nothing. Only you picked out a run-about,
a little branch of river, that wanders
out of course and then comes home again.
Begins and ends the same. Oh! you’re
wise, you are.”</p>

<p>“Would the other lead us right?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“But it turns north. We’re bound
south.”</p>

<p>“That’s no matter. Can’t a river turn,
same as run-about?”</p>

<p>“I give up. You guide. I’ll stick to my
brush.”</p>

<p>This restored affairs to the ground which
Pierre considered proper, and, having
paused long enough to eat a lunch, they set
out afresh. The new track they followed
ascended steadily, and it proved a difficult
stream to warp up; but the ascent was accomplished
without accident, and then the
surface of the land altered. Again they
reached a point where two branches met,
and Pierre explained that the waters of one
ran due north, but the other bent gradually
toward the south and in a little while descended
through one of the most dangerous
“rips” he had ever seen.</p>

<p>“Only saw them once, either. When I
went as far as Donovan’s with the master,
year before last.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t know he ever came so far from
the island.”</p>

<p>“Why, he goes once every summer, or
fall, as far as that New York of yours.
Likely he’ll be going soon again.”</p>

<p>“He does! Queer he never mentioned
it.”</p>

<p>“Maybe. I’ve a notion, though, that the
things he don’t say are more important than
what he does. Ever shoot a rip?”</p>

<p>“No. I’ve tried and failed. That’s how
I happened to get lost and wandered to Dutton’s.”</p>

<p>“He’s the boss hand at it. Seems as if
the danger fired him up. Makes him feel
as I do when I hunt big game. He didn’t
need my help, only fetched me along to take
back some truck. That’s how he picked me
out to show you. He knew I knew&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And I wish I knew&mdash;lots of things!”</p>

<p>“One of ’em might be that round that
next turn comes the first dip. Then look
out.”</p>

<p>The stream was descending very perceptibly,
and they needed no paddling to
keep them moving. But they did require
to be incessantly on the watch to guard
against the rocks which obstructed the current,
and which threatened the safety of
their frail craft.</p>

<p>“You keep an eye on me and one on the
channel. It’ll take a clear head to carry
us through, and no fooling.”</p>

<p>Adrian did not answer. He had no
thought for anything just then but the
menace of those jagged points; which
seemed to reach toward them as if to destroy.</p>

<p>Nor did Pierre speak again. Far better
even than his silent companion could he
estimate the perils which beset them. Life
itself was the price which they would pay
for a moment’s carelessness, but a cool head,
a clear eye, and a steady wrist&mdash;these meant
safety and the proud record of a dangerous
passage wisely made. A man who could
shoot those rapids was a guide who might,
indeed, some time demand the high wages
Adrian had jeered at.</p>

<p>Suddenly the channel seemed barred by
two opposing boulders, whose points lapped
each other. In reality, there was a way between
them, by the shortest of curves and
of but little more than the canoe’s width.
Pierre saw and measured the distance skillfully,
but he had not counted upon the opposing
force of the water that rushed
against them.</p>

<p>“Look&mdash;out! Take&mdash;”</p>

<p>Behind the right-hand rock seethed a
mighty whirlpool, where the river, speeding
downward, was caught and tossed back
upon itself, around and around, mad to
escape yet bound by its own power.</p>

<p>Into this vortex the canoe was hurled, to
be instantly overturned and dashed to pieces
on the rock.</p>

<p>On its first circuit of the pool, Adrian
leaped and landed upon the slippery boulder&mdash;breathless,

clasped the pole he had been using to steer
with, and Pierre&mdash;? He had almost disappeared
within the whirling water, that
tossed him like a feather.</p>

<h3>AUK’S MYSTERY.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>ITHOUT doubt most persons, should
we ask them where Auk might
be found, would laugh at us.
“Auk?” they would say; “why he’s been
dead for over half a century.” This seems
very likely, since he has been neither seen
nor heard of for a long time. But let me
whisper a word in your ear: “Auk is still
alive.” But why should he hide this way?
Well, there is a very good reason for it, as
you will see.</p>

<p>To our mind Auk was badly treated. He
was certainly not to blame for being unattractive:
neither was it his fault that he was
clumsy. He had lived on the shore of the
Great South Bay for years, and supported
himself comfortably by his industry. But
he was kept from making friends by his
awkward manners. It is easy enough for
us to see the meaning of the word awkward
now, even if it is spelled with a “w” instead
of a “u,” but that is of little importance.</p>

<p>Auk was a fisherman, and all his time,
when not resting, was spent on the water.
Although, as we have said, he was clumsy
on land, Auk was a very graceful swimmer.
More than that, he could stay under the
water a long time, so that few fish, indeed,
escaped him. This, of course, made many
birds dislike him. They feared that there
would be no fish left for them. To avert
this danger, the Heron family, Tern, and
most of the Gulls&mdash;all, in fact, except
Black-head, who was too happy to quarrel
with anyone&mdash;called a council. They would
get rid of Auk.</p>

<p>On the water, they knew, they could not
harm him in the least: he was far too good
a swimmer for that. But on the land he
would be at their mercy. As every one
knows, Auk could not fly. He had been
growing too heavy of late years.</p>

<p>So Tern proposed that the birds wait
until night, when it was Auk’s habit to go
back on the shore quite a way from the
water to sleep. If they attacked him there
he would be an easy prey.</p>

<p>As soon as the sun had gone down Auk’s
enemies gathered on the shore just below
the long sand-bar. About dark Sandpiper
at the suggestion of Night-Heron, stole
quietly along the shore to learn if Auk was
asleep. It took him but a few minutes to
reach the spot where the great bulky fellow
rested while sitting bolt upright. So excited
was Sandpiper that his heart beat
wildly, and he had hardly gotten half way
back when he called out to his friends,
“Asleep! Asleep!”</p>

<p>Now Auk, even when in a sound slumber,
always kept his ears wide open. That’s
how he happened to hear Sandpiper’s
piping voice telling the other birds that he
was asleep. At first he thought he had
been dreaming, but when he saw the dark
forms down on the sand-bar he realized the
truth and knew that he was in peril.</p>

<p>Greatly frightened, Auk hurried to the
water, as was his habit in all danger. It
was well he did, for, in the next instant.
Blue Heron, Tern, and a host of others
came flying swiftly toward him. In another
moment Auk dived headlong into the
sea and swam rapidly away, while his enemies
stood on the shore crying out in their
disappointment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Years passed and Auk was forgotten.
Everyone supposed that he had long ago
fallen prey to some enemy. Then, one
night, Birdland was astonished. Night-Heron
had been to the far north for some
time past. Suddenly he came bursting in
upon them. His eyes were wide open with
wonder. All he could say was the word
“Quok! Quok!” which everyone knew
was his way of saying “Auk,” Night-Heron
being slightly tongue-tied. After
he had gotten over his excitement the birds
learned of his trip to Granite Island.
Whom do you suppose he found there? It
was no less a person than Auk.</p>

<p>At first folks thought Night-Heron’s
mind had been wandering. But when he
became calmer, and related his discovery,
they could no longer refuse to believe him.
All the old anger of the fishing birds
seemed to arouse itself again. For years
and years they had thought Auk was dead,
and now they learned that he was still living
and probably laughing at their stupidity.</p>

<p>Quickly gathering together, they started
north. This time he would not escape
them. It took many days of tiresome
flight, but at last they could see Granite
Island in the dim distance ahead of them.
As they drew near, their anger increased
and their cries cut the air. Just try to
imagine their feelings then, when, upon
nearer approach, they found that Auk was
not there.</p>

<p>The truth was that Black-head had flown
ahead of the party and warned Auk of his
danger. Now he was circling high in
air, and every now and then he would break
out in laughter: “Gone! Ha! ha! ha!
Gone! Ha! ha! ha!”</p>

<p>But this defeat only hardened the purpose
of the fishing birds. They still continue
to hunt for Auk. Watch any of
them if you will while on the sea-shore.
See how tirelessly Tern is searching as he
skims over wave after wave. Will he ever
find Auk? At any rate, he will not give up.
But then, when we think of the broad expanse
of the Great North Ocean, and its
many rocky islands, we cannot but feel that
Auk is pretty safe after all. He has found
a good hiding-place somewhere.</p>

<p>You who have been believing that Auk
has been extinct for half a century, now
know that it is not so. But where is he?
There is only one whom you can ask: that
is Black-head. He will tell you nothing.
Try it and see. His only reply is a laugh:
“Gone! Ha! ha! ha! Gone! Ha! ha! ha!”</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE is no holiday which appeals so
directly to the boy as does the Fourth
of July. Easter with its spirit of
hopefulness, Thanksgiving with its bounty
of turkey, or even Christmas with all its
cheer and good will, does not, for some
reason, reach the same depths of the boy
nature as does the boom and sizz of fire
crackers. There is something of the savage
in him which delights in this almost barbaric
method of commemorating the courage of
his forefathers; for the Fourth of July is
pre-eminently a day of courage.</p>

<p>Without doubt we all admire bravery,
but, while we are honoring those who so
willingly exposed themselves to the bullet
and bayonet, let us not lose sight of that
courage which, though silent, was in reality
the strength of the American Revolution&mdash;the
courage born of conviction. It was
this spirit which spoke through Richard
Henry Lee when he proposed that the
United Colonies, with a few poorly-armed
troops, should renounce their allegiance to
the most powerful nation in the world. It
was this which prompted John Adams to
second the movement in Congress, and
there, by his eloquence, to uphold it day
after day in the face of an opposition so
strong that Jefferson compared it with the
ceaseless action of gravity.</p>

<p>The desire for independence was not bred
of impulse. No one foresaw the danger of
thus defying England more clearly than
those who cried out for the separation.
They knew that it would expose them, individually
and collectively, to all the penalties
of treason. But they had become convinced
that it was right, and, to them, that fact was
sufficient.</p>

<p>Seemingly there is something of elasticity
in this moral courage which leaps over obstacles
before which mere physical courage
would halt. Under the warmth of this
spirit, with the strength of Patrick Henry,
John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson behind
it, the opposition slowly melted away, until,
on July 4, 1776, the entire body declared for
the Declaration.</p>

<p>The representatives of the thirteen colonies
had assembled in the old State House
at Philadelphia. An anxious throng, from
far and near, had gathered about the rough
brick walls, for within was being discussed
the momentous question of their liberties.
Of a sudden, the ponderous bell overhead
awoke and sent its pealing echoes from
river to river, and at the same instant, as
from one voice, a wild, excited cheer burst
forth from the crowd below, to be taken up
in every city in the land. Thus, in one of
the darkest hours of their history, the colonies
had declared themselves independent
of a nation which had considered them all
but conquered.</p>

<p>Now, when we celebrate the one-hundred-and-twenty-sixth
anniversary of our country’s
birth, let us remember and honor those
who made it possible. There is still, and
will ever be, a call for the same moral courage
which, in the face of such overpowering
obstacles, built our nation. Not only on the
Fourth of July, but during every day of the
year, let us keep their example before us.</p>

<h3>Seventeen-Year “Locust”</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> occurrence sufficiently rare to awaken interest,
which has taken place during the past
month, is the arrival of the seventeen-year cicada,
commonly, though improperly, termed locust.</p>

<p>These insects, which since the year 1885 have
spent their entire lives in the ground, have, during
the past six weeks, appeared in great numbers
in various localities throughout the country.</p>

<p>In any of these areas, if we observe the ground
closely, we will see it dotted here and there with
small holes. Through these the cicadas, after
living underground for seventeen years, have
now made their way to the surface. Here, with
the shedding of the old shell, they take on a pair
of wings, and after a short but noisy life of perhaps
six weeks, they die. But in the meantime
they have laid the eggs which insure a future
brood of cicadas.</p>

<p>The recording of the periodical visits of this
insect dates as far back as 1633, when, it is stated,
that a swarm was observed by the Puritans at
the Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>For many years our knowledge of the cicada,
because of its underground habits, has been extremely
limited, but at a comparatively recent
date the Biological Survey at Washington has
made a series of careful investigations, resulting
in a very full history of the life and habits of this
curious insect.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img class="center" src="images/eac.jpg" alt="decoration" />
    </div>

<p>Among other facts relating to the cicada,
brought out by the research, is that, as is the case
of many creatures of which we know little, the
damage done by it to agriculture has been
greatly overestimated.</p>

<h3>The Boer War Ended</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">War</span> in South Africa was formally brought to
an end when, on May 31st, the Boer delegates at
Pretoria signed the documents containing the
terms of surrender.</p>

<p>The war began on October 11th, 1899, and
has lasted two years seven months and twenty-one
days. It has cost England $1,200,000,000,
besides which they have suffered a loss of 21,966
killed and 75,000 prisoners and wounded.</p>

<p>The estimated loss of the Boers is 19,000 lives
and 40,000 captured.</p>

<p>The greatest force of troops which England
had in the field at any one time was 280,000, while
estimates of the Boer army vary from 25,000 to
50,000.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img class="center" src="images/eac.jpg" alt="decoration" />
    </div>

<p>The terms of peace allowed to the Boers are,
perhaps, the best ever offered to a conquered
people. Among its conditions are: Immunity
from war indemnity, the substitution of representative
for military administration, and a gift
of fifteen millions of dollars for the re-stocking
of their farms.</p>

<h3>The Cuban Republic</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> May 20th, Governor-General Wood, according
to his instructions from the President of
the United States, turned over to President
Palma and his Congress the government and
control of the island of Cuba.</p>

<p>During the impressive ceremony President
Palma, amid the cheers of the spectators, expressed
his thanks to the Government of the
United States for the fulfillment of its pledges
and its kindly services to the new republic.</p>

<p>According to the <i>Boston Herald</i>, “the American
flag was never more highly honored than
when it was hauled down by Governor-General
Leonard Wood from the Government building at
Havana.”</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img class="center" src="images/eac.jpg" alt="decoration" />
    </div>

<p>There is probably no parallel in history of this
act of the United States in which a nation, after
having won so rich a territorial prize in war,
eventually turned it over to its people for free
government.</p>

<h3>The New Trains</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the most significant railway trials ever
held in this or any country was that recently
made between New York and Chicago, by the
special train of the Pennsylvania Railroad and
the “Twentieth Century” of the New York Central.</p>

<p>Although the two trains went by widely separate
routes, they covered the required distance,
over nine hundred miles, in the same time to the
minute&mdash;19 hours and 57 minutes.</p>

<p>This is three minutes less than the schedule
time allowed, and is fully three hours faster than
any speed previously made over the same course.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img class="center" src="images/eac.jpg" alt="decoration" />
    </div>

<p>As these new trains are now regularly on the
schedules of their respective roads, the race will
hereafter be an every-day occurrence, and we
may look forward even to the lowering of this
record.</p>

<h3>Foreign Immigration</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the month of May the total number of
immigrants arriving at New York was between
85,000 and 90,000.</p>

<p>This exceeds any monthly record for the past
twenty years. The majority of the new arrivals
were from Austria-Hungary, Italy, and Russia.
In a count of 51,000 immigrants it was found that
14,000 could neither read nor write.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img class="center" src="images/eac.jpg" alt="decoration" />
    </div>

<p>Although at present this does not promise
much for the standard of American citizenship,
we can reasonably hope that in time our system
of education will convert their descendants, at
least, into very useful citizens.</p>

been a long-coveted speed among runners,
and is very likely to stand for some time as
the world’s record.</p>

Illinois, who has defeated Yale, Princeton,
and Pennsylvania, and was only beaten by
Harvard by a score of 2 to 1.</p>

<p>Both Annapolis and West Point, considering
the difficulties under which they
practice, have made such a good showing

taking a more prominent place on the diamond
in future.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N spite of the fact that polo is only locally
well known in this country, it has already
taken a strong hold upon the
people. An evidence of this may be found
in the American team which went over to
London to compete with the best English
players. During their stay the visitors will
be royally entertained, and will remain in
England to observe the coronation.</p>

<p>Interest in the games has been increased

enthusiastic supporter of the sport.</p>

<h3>PARLOR MAGIC
  </h3>
<p class="h2sub">By Ellis Stanyon
  </p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The first of this series of papers on Magic, commencing
with the March number, included directions
to the beginner for Palming and the Pass.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tricks with Handkerchiefs.</span>&mdash;For the
following experiments, you will require
three fifteen-inch silk handkerchiefs, an ordinary
small sliding match-box, a candle
in a candlestick, and a conjuring wand;
also a false finger and a conjuring pistol,
hereafter described.</p>

<p>You prepare for the series of tricks by
rolling up one of the handkerchiefs very
small and pushing it into the match-box,
which you open about one inch for the purpose;
another is rolled up and placed behind
the collar on the left-hand side of the
neck; and the last is loaded into the false
finger and placed in the right-hand trousers
pocket. You are now ready to commence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Handkerchief and Candle.</span>&mdash;“Ladies
and gentlemen, the following experiment
was suggested to me at the age of twelve,
while studying chemistry. I then learned
that all matter was indestructible. Proof
of this, as you are well aware, is afforded
with an ordinary candle. You may light
a candle at one end and let it burn to the
other, but you do not destroy the matter
of which it is composed. What really
takes place is the formation of new substances,
as hydrogen, carbon, water, etc.,
which any of the text books on chemistry
will explain. I will, however, give you one
striking illustration.”</p>

<p>Pick up the match-box and, while taking
a match therefrom, push the handkerchief
into the right hand, and throw the box
down on the table. Take the candle from
the candlestick and place it in the right
hand, which masks the presence of the handkerchief.
You now appear to take something
from the flame of the candle with the
left hand, which you close as if it really
contained an article. Open the hand
slowly, looking surprised to find that you
have failed and remark: “Well, really, I
cannot understand this. I am generally
successful with this trick. Oh! I know
what is the matter. You see, I am using
the left hand. If you do things left-handed
they can’t possibly be right. I will
try the right hand.” Saying this, you place
the candle in the left hand and immediately
produce the handkerchief from the flame,
closing the hand as before. It now only
remains for you to open the hand and develop
the silk slowly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<p><span class="smcap">To Fire a Handkerchief into a Gentleman’s
Hair.</span>&mdash;For the purpose of this
trick you will have to make use of what is
known as a conjuring pistol, which, being
in constant use in magical surprises, I will
describe. It consists of an ordinary pistol
fitted with a conical tin tube eight inches
long. The mouth of this tube is about two
inches in diameter, and is supplied with a
tin cup one and one-half inches deep, having
its outer edge turned over all around so as
to afford a ready grip to the palm. The
conical tube is fitted with an inner tube to
keep it firm on the barrel of the pistol (Fig.
10).</p>

    alt="Pistol with conical extension over barrel and cap for extension." />
  <div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 10</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Taking up the pistol, you place the two
handkerchiefs, which look like one, in the
cup; push them well down and remark: “I
shall now fire direct at the gentleman’s
head, and after the shot the handkerchief
will be found firmly imbedded in his hair,
and will, not unlikely, be seen protruding
from one of his ears. It just depends on
the force of the shot, you know, and I need
hardly say I loaded the pistol myself, and
am totally ignorant of firearms. Are you
ready, sir? Then good-by!” Place the
muzzle of the pistol in the left hand while
you shake hands with the gentleman. In
taking the pistol back into the right hand
to fire it, you leave the cup behind in the
left hand, and, at the instant you pull the
trigger, you drop it into the pocket on the
left side. When discharging the pistol you
will, of course, stand with your right side
to the audience.</p>

<p>You now ask the gentleman to take the
handkerchief from his hair, telling him that
it is just behind his left ear; and, while he
is trying to find it, you stand with your
hands in your trousers pockets, telling him
to make haste, you cannot wait all evening.
When he has tried some time and failed to
find it, you take your hands from your
pockets, having got the false finger into
position between the second and third fingers.
Showing the hands back and front
(the addition of the extra finger will not
be noticed), you pass them several times
over the head of the gentleman, then, lowering
them to his head, you detach the finger
and draw out the handkerchief. The
false finger is then laid down on the table
under cover of the handkerchief.</p>

<p>The finger is made of thin spun brass,
painted flesh color. It is quite hollow from
tip to root, and is shaped for fitting between
the second and third fingers (Fig. 11). It
can be used in many tricks, and is really an
indispensable accessory to the amateur
magician.</p>

<p>It accidentally happens that the lumber now occasionally

seven years is such that no Occidental country
produces. I am sure editors so agree. So omitting
any explanation, I merely state the fact.
Tippoo-Tib bargains for all of it. Overflowing
with oil it is always in a bad muss. Oporto
is the place to which it is shipped. When it arrives
whole machines are made from it, giving, I
presume, employment to many persons who are
constantly on the go during business hours, the
parents and children working side by side. All
sorts of religionists there mix, Ebionites even
being found among them, who strive and fret
to make converts to their faith, and they, as those
at the Po let names weigh more than deeds. I
would not say this did I know it to be false.</p>

<h3><i>THE NEW DEPARTMENT</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> we have opened our new department,
“Out of Doors,” a little later than was
intended, we believe that it will meet with favor
among our readers. We hope, too, that, in the
future, it will grow in size as well as in interest.</p>

<h3><i>TO CONTRIBUTORS</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> publishers of <span class="smcap">Youth</span> desire to state that
for a time, hereafter, they will be unable to examine
manuscripts submitted for publication,
except those to be entered in the Prize Competition.
Full particulars in regard to this offer
will be found in one of the advertising pages of
this issue.</p>

<h3><i>50c. FOR TWENTY-FIVE NAMES</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Anyone</span> who will send us the names and addresses
of twenty-five of his friends, boys or girls,
and fifty cents additional, will receive a year’s
subscription to <span class="smcap">Youth</span>. The magazine will be
sent to any desired address. This is a very easy
way for any person, young or old, to obtain a
year’s subscription. We wish the twenty-five
names for the sole purpose of distributing sample
copies of <span class="smcap">Youth</span>. They will be put to no other
use, so that no one need have any hesitation in
sending the list.</p>

<h3><i>AN EASY WAY TO EARN MONEY</i></h3>

<p>In order to increase the circulation of <span class="smcap">Youth</span>
as rapidly as possible, we have decided to make
some exceptional inducements to boys and girls
to obtain subscriptions. The work can be done
after school hours, and on Saturdays and holidays.
The arrangement we make for doing the
canvassing renders the work very agreeable, and
the commission offered is so large that it cannot
fail to be an inducement.</p>

<p>To such of our readers as would like to earn a
considerable sum of money with little effort, we
suggest that they send us their names and addresses,
and we will at once forward full particulars.</p>

<h3><i>SPECIAL SUBSCRIPTION OFFER</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> order to make it a substantial object for our
subscribers to interest themselves in extending
the circulation of <span class="smcap">Youth</span>, we have decided to
make the following special offer:</p>

<p>For every new subscription sent us we will send,
free of all cost, one of any of the books named in
the accompanying list. These books are the
latest and best stories of the most popular writers
for boys and girls. They are beautifully illustrated
and handsomely bound. The regular price
of each book is $1.25. This is an exceptional
opportunity for any one to add to his library
with little effort, and we trust that a very large
number of our subscribers will quickly avail
themselves of this special offer. This, of course,
does not apply to those taking advantage of our
other subscription offers.</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website

to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
